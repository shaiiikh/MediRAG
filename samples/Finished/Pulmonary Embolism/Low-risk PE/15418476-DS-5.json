The patient reported that this past he had a colonoscopy, at which 6 polyps were removed, and after the colonoscopy developed shooting pain down his right leg.  This pain resolved quickly however developed into a severe right fifth toe pain.  He states that this pain has been consistent and severe for the past 5 days.  Worse when he is walking or when he is elevating his leg, partially relieved by dragging his foot off the bed.  Given these symptoms he presented to an outside hospital where an arterial duplex ultrasound of the right leg was obtained and demonstrated a right mid occlusion with reversal of flow distal to the occlusion. Therefore he was transferred for vascular surgery evaluation.\n\ufeff\nCurrently, the patient states that he has continued pain.  He has never had symptoms like this before, and he has no known arterial disease.  Apart from his foot he has been in his usual state of health, and denies all other symptoms.\n\ufeff\n",
