Pt reports last feeling well when he noticed increasing SOB and fatigue.  He was later admitted for acute on chronic systolic CHF and new onset atrial fibrillation for which cardioversion could not be achieved.  He was discharged with a number of changes to his medication regimen which included increasing Metoprolol from 25 to 100 XL and Furosemide from 20 to 40mg daily.  Although he had scripts for these two medication changes, he was not able to take the increased dose because of difficulty with insurance approval.  In the last week the patient has reported worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea with little exertion. He hasn't been able to sleep for the last 3 nights because of PND and need to sit upright. He reports drinking his normal intake of water but reports infrequent urination with small volumes. Additionally, he reports having a diet with high salt content. Reports non-productive cough for several weeks. Denies fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  After gaining 5lbs today, he saw his PCP who recommended he come to the ED.  \n\nIn the ED, initial vitals were 95.1 106 132/98 24 100% ra. CXR demonstrated mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Labs notable for elevated BNP to 4000, subtherapeutic 1.6. He was given 20mg IV lasix. EKG demonstrated prior anterior infarct. \n\nOn review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  \n\nCardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, syncope or presyncope.\n",
