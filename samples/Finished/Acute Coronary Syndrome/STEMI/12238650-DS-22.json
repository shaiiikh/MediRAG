He underwent a nuclearstress test that demonstrated METs with chest pain symptoms. Normal myocardial perfusion study. LVEF 46&\". In addition, a TTE demonstrated \"LVEF 60-65%, normal RV, mild MR\".\n\nHe was seen that his chest pain was attributed to possible angina though this was deemed less likely given his negative stress testing. Given his risk factors and family history the patient, along with his cardiologist elected to pursue angiography. \n\nThe patient underwent elective coronary angiography which demonstrated a 90% proximal LAD lesion for which a 3.0x12 Xience (DES). He was loaded with ticagrelor and discharged the same day. \n\nThe patient was seen in the CDAC for abdominal discomfort that is exacerbated after eating food ever since he started taking his ticagrelor. He was instructed to start pantoprazole and to discontinue his ticagrelor. He was given a prescription for clopidogrel 75mg daily after a 300mg loading dose. \n\nHe had taken his morning dose of ticagrelor. He was instructed to hold his evening dose and load with clopidogrel 300mg the next morning. The patient went to his pharmacy that evening to pick up his prescription. The pharmacist said they did not have the 300mg loading dose available but that the patient should come back the next day to pick it up. The patient took clopidogrel 75mg the next morning with plans to  pick up his loading dose later in the day. \n\nHowever, before the patient could pick up with prescription, he had the sudden onset of sharp, mid-abdominal pain. This was without radiation, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. \n\nHis vitals on presentation were notable for T 98.2 HR 73 R 16 BP146/101 SpO2 99. His Chemistry panel was wnl. LFTs were notable for AST 20 ALT 38 AP 62 and Lipase 128. INR was 1.2 CBC was wnl.\n\nHe underwent a CT abd which showed evidence of mild pancreatitis. He was admitted for abdominal pain with concern for pancretitis.\n\nHis ECG on admission demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 with normal axis and intervals. There was TWI in V4-6 and STD I-II. \n\nThe next day, the patient reported sudden onset of dyspnea, nausea/vomiting and diaphoresis. An ECG was obtained which demonstrated sinus rhythm at a rate of 89 with STE V2-V5 and aVL with reciprocal changed in II and III. He was transferred out of concern for in-stent thrombosis.\n\nUpon arrival, he was taken directly to the cath lab where he underwent coronary angiography via the R radial artery. This demonstrated complete occlusion of the LAD for which he received POBA. \n\nHe was then transferred to the floor where he was complaining of mild dyspnea but improved abdominal pain. He has no fevers or chills. No chest pain or papliations. His ECG showed improved anteroseptal STEs.\n\nOf note, the patient has had an episode of pancreatitis that was thought to be possible due to biliary obstruction but  no stones were seen on EUS. Therefore the etiology was thought to  be from resolved choledocholithiasis vs. idiopathic. The patient states that this abdominal pain is very similar to this episode.\n",
