The patient reports that he was in his usual state of health until 2 days prior to presentation. He reported intermittent worsening of his left sided weakness for 2 days prior to presentation to ED, lasting briefly on the order of seconds and improving between episodes. He told his wife this but did not present for further evaluation at that time. He then became increasingly agitated and confused. The evening before presentation, the patient was restless and intermittently yelling. On presentation to ___, the patient denied any focal symptoms other than a slight cough and a headache (frontal, ___ pain, improved with Tylenol). He was found to have an UTI growing enterococcus, for which he was started on ceftriaxone.
