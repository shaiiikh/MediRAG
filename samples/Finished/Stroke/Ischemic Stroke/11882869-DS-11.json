Evolving acute infarct in the right basal ganglia and multiple additional punctate acute infarcts along the periphery of the right parietal and temporal lobes seen on subsequent MRI are not well depicted on this CT. \n2. Abrupt cut off of the distal M1 segment of the right internal carotid artery with high-grade focal narrowing at the origin of the right M2 superior division and nonvisualization of the M2 inferior division. \n3. Extensive calcified and soft atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bifurcations extending into the proximal portion of the internal and external carotid arteries results in approximately 50% narrowing of the internal carotid artery origins by NASCET criteria. \n4. There is a 6 x 8 mm spiculated right upper lobe pulmonary nodule in addition to a nodular area of parenchymal consolidation with adjacent distortion along the periphery of the left upper lobe measuring 1.6 x 2.1 cm.  There also multiple mildly prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.  Comparison with prior chest CTs, if available available is recommended.  Alternatively, dedicated chest CT or PET-CT can be considered for further evaluation, as malignancy cannot be excluded. \n\ufeff\nMRI brain\nIMPRESSION: \n  \n  \n1. Late acute infarcts in the right MCA distribution predominantly involving the right basal ganglia and posterior limb of the right internal capsule with multiple additional punctate foci in the right external capsule, insula, parietal and temporal lobes. \n2.

Bilateral superior pulmonary spiculated nodules measuring up to 11 mm highly concerning for primary lung malignancy. \n2.  Partially seen distal pancreatic atrophy disproportionate to the size of the head on a background of chronic pancreatitis as well a CBD stent with expected pneumobilia.  These findings could be due to an underlying pancreatic malignancy such as adenocarcinoma, particularly in the setting \nof a stent.  Alternatively, sequela of chronic pancreatitis are possible as \ndescribed. \n  \nRECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlation with pancreaticobiliary history, \ncomparison with prior imaging.  An addendum can be issued if requested with a comparison of the findings if prior imaging becomes available. \n\ufeff\nTTE:\nThe left atrial volume index is mildly increased. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\n"
