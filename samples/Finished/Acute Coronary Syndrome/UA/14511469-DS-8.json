Of note, he was scheduled for elective catheterization today.\n\ufeff\nHis pain began around 10pm yesterday after eating fish for dinner and was diffuse, pressure, across his chest, radiating to both arms and neck, and associated with diaphoresis.  There was no SOB, N/V.  He took 1 NTG and called EMS.  After his second NTG his pain improved significantly. He was also given an aspirin. He is currently pain free.  \n\ufeff\nHe does not generally experience exertional chest pain but beginning about two weeks ago he began to experience chest pain while on his treadmill and improving with rest.  He had not required any NTGs.\n\ufeff\nPer documentation, he had onset of pressure across his anterior chest occurring at rest and was taken by EMS. Apparently, his chest symptoms resolved after having been given additional aspirin in about one hour. He has no recall having  been given nitroglycerin. In the ED, ECG was reported as normal  and troponin slightly elevated to 0.133 (top normal at 0.045).  \nD-dimer was negative. Renal function was normal. Because of the elevated troponin, he was advised to have immediate cardiac catheterization, but signed out against advice and came to see \nDr. at his regularly scheduled appointment.\n \nIn the ED, initial vitals were 76 128/65 16 100% RA.

He has no complaints.\n\ufeff\nROS positive for 3 pillow orthopnea which has been stable \"for years\"\n\ufeff\nOn review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional extremity pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  \n \nCardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.\n",
