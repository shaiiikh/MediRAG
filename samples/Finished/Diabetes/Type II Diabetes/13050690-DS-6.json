    "input2": "She is a right-handed woman with history notable for prior right occipital IPHs ascribed to suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy, HTN, diet-controlled HLD, and anxiety transferred from after presenting with transient right foot paresthesiae. She reports going to bed yesterday evening in her usual state of health. On waking up this morning at 08:30, she noticed \"tingling\" paresthesiae over the sole of her right foot on rising from bed. She describes the sensation as 'pins and needles' similar to her foot falling asleep, but had not woken up in an unusual position or rested her leg on any hard surface overnight. Her paresthesiae did not resolve over the next few minutes, prompting her to activate EMS. There, she underwent a non-contrast head CT that was noted to have a few new linear areas of hyperdensity in the area of a prior parietal infarct; as a subdural hematoma could not beexcluded per report, she was transferred for Neurosurgical evaluation. Notably, her symptoms resolved while obtaining her imaging, lasting approximately two hours in total. She denies a similar recent history of paresthesiae, and denies headache, back pain, leg pain, focal weakness, vision change, speech disturbance, or gait disturbance associated with her most recent episode. She was recently seen in the ED for a small CT hyperdensity in the setting of headaches, which was felt to reflect mineralization vs. residual hemorrhage from prior infarct as well as hypertension, respectively. She was also recently admitted for a right parietooccipital IPH. \n\ufeff\nROS: As above; also denies recent fevers, chills, cough, congestion, chest discomfort, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
