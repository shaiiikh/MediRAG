The oral prednisone was prescribed by ENT doctor nasal polyps.  The course of prednisone is now complete and he is no longer on this medication (last took when taper completed).  He was not able to be transitioned to insulin therapy safely in the outpatient setting.  Please see OMR notes from NP Brain doctor.\n.\nPatient reports significant fatigue, urinary frequency.  He says he has suffered considerably with his nasal polyps.  He denies any recent chest discomfort but says that sometimes with extreme exertion, he'll get anterior chest discomfort.  He denies any shortness of breath.  He is otherwise feeling well. 10 point review of systems is negative except for noted above.\n",

This was not able to be be achieved safely in the outpatient setting so he is thus admitted to ensure safe care.  Metformin was continued at it's current dose. There was concern that Lantus would be too expensive for him given his current insurance, so he was given insulin 70/30 so he would only need 2 injections a day. His fasting glucose was 170 with this. He will record his fasting glucoses for the next week so his insulin can be adjusted.\ufeff\n",
