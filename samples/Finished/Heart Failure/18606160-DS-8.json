The medical history is reviewed, revealing for recent clinical diagnosis with Temporal Arteritis for which the patient has been on Steroid therapy with side effects of hyperglycemia and steroid myopathy. In an attempt to facilitate steroid dose reduction Methotrexate 10mg daily was added. The patient was seen by Rheumatology at which time palate ulceration was noted. Fungal culture was negative, viral culture not processed because of wrong culture tube but the patient was started on Acyclovir 400mg PO tid x 10 days and Methotrexate was not escalated any further. The patient since that time has been undergoing Prednisone taper with reduction in Prednisone dose from 30mg to 20mg. the patient called the clinic with report of evolving pain and dryness of her mouth for which nystatin swish and swallow was empirically started. Yesterday, note was made that the patient initially improved with nystatin but symptoms have since worsened for which oral lidocaine was prescribed. The patient was seen at clinic today per her report, no note yet available for review, and was sent to the ED for concern for recent diarrheal episode, diuretic use and finding of tachycardia to 120 in office. Per discussion with patient she reports predominant symptom that is bothering her is sense of dry mouth. She reports this has been ongoing for last 2 days with sensation of mild burning over her tongue. She denies pain over palate or mucosa, no known ulcers that she has noted herself. The patient denies any sense of dry eyes or pain. She reports if anything she has been experiencing sense of watery eyes over the last couple of days. The patient reports she has been taking POs well over last couple of weeks. She had 1 day where she had episodes of loose stool but this was otherwise self-resolving. She has noted increasing edema over few weeks for which she took 1 dose of diuretic a few days ago (does not recall name that was prescribed by her PCP. The patient has been wearing TEDs stockings for this.\nED Course: 98.3, 145/69, 113, 18, 97% RA. In the ED the patient had labs revealing for UA with > 50 WBC, WBC 10.9, Cr of 1.0 and lactate of 1.5. The patient received 2L NS without improvement in tachycardia. The patient is now admitted to the medical service for evaluation and treatment per discretion of emergency department given concern discharging patient with persistent tachycardia.\n",
