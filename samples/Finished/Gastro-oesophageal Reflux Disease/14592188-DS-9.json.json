That prompted an EGD without biopsy which confirmed severe inflammation. He was placed on a variety of PPI's all of which caused some diarrhea. Another EGD with biopsy was done 3 weeks ago and he was told that he has a precancerous condition. He is not aware of the term barretts esophagus and we do not  have any path from that EGD. He was referred to Dr. to discuss potential surgery. He has never had any manomatry or Ph studies nor has he had a barium swallow. Currently he denies any heartburn, acid reflux, change in weight, dysphagia. His only complaints are that of a cough and sinus congestion. He was recently given a Zpak but does not notice any improvement. He is a current smoker.\n",
