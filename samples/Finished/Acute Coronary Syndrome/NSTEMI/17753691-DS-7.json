He has also subsequently developed associated diaphoresis, dizziness and nausea without vomiting over the past weeks. He had new back pain also several weeks ago that starts in the back and goes  down toward his groin- it feel like muscle spasms to him but is now resolved. No chest pain during any of these episodes. He denies being sob. Denies leg pain or swelling. He went into hospital because he thought he was having ulcers and was expected some \"tums\" and being d/ced. However labs showed a 0.87 trop-i, w/ 0.9 Cr, and ekg showed inf t wave changes, abd labs were unremarkable, glu 279. he was given asa, heparin and nitro drips for hypertension. Transfer was attmpted to hospital where the pt has his pcp, but transfer was not possible.\n \nIn the ED, initial vitals were 94 122/83 13 99%. Labs were notable for a WBC of 14, trop of 0.1 with a normal CK-MB and INR of 1.2. EKG demonstrated sinus at 87 Q in III, avf and lateral t-wave flattening similar to prior. The patient was continued on a heparin gtt. Given metoprolol 25 mg and taken to the cath lab. \nThere he was given a plavix load, ASA, and bival. In the cath lab he was noted to have an extremely tight LAD (near complete occlusion) without evidence of collaterals. He underwent placement of a DES to the LAD with good restoration of flow. The procedure was complicated by a vagal event for which the patient recieved 1 mg of atropine and L fluid with improvement in blood pressure and heart rate.\n",
