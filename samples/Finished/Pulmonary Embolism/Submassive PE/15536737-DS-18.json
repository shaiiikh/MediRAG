Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 49 %. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \n\ufeff\nBILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS DOPPLER US\nThere is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation of the bilateral common femoral and femoral veins.  There is normal color flow in the right posterior tibial and peroneal veins. The left popliteal vein is not compressible and is partially occluded by echogenic thrombus. However, there is normal color flow in the left posterior tibial veins. The left peroneal veins are not visualized. There is normal respiratory variation in the common \nfemoral veins bilaterally. No evidence of medial popliteal fossa cyst. \n\ufeff\nPULMONARY ARTERIOGRAM\nLeft pulmonary arteriogram demonstrates numerous filling defects within the branches of the left pulmonary artery consistent with findings on prior CTA chest. Right pulmonary arteriogram demonstrates numerous filling defects within the branches of the right pulmonary artery consistent with findings on prior CTA chest. Final fluoroscopic image of the chest demonstrate appropriate placement of the bilateral EKOS catheters. \n\ufeff\n"
