During her prior admission, she had presented with profuse watery and frankly bloody diarrhea. She had a MRI which showed 'descending colitis'. She was started on azithromycin until stool cultures returned negative. Her symptoms had improved and she was discharged home after two days on a regular diet. She felt she never improved to back to her normal baseline and continued to have intermittent diarrhea and abomdinal pain. She saw a GI as an outpatient on , had labs sent (unsure what they were testing for, thinking maybe IBD). Today, she experienced severe worsening of left-sided abdominal pain with acid regurgitation and heartburn. She was transferred to for higher level of care given she is wga. She reports pain is left sided, cramping, at worst times radiates throughout abdomen in in upper back. No fevers/chills. No nausea/vomiting. Last BM 3 pm yesterday, diarrhea, non bloody, no mucous. No recent travel, unusual foods, sick contacts. No rash, changes in skin/hair, joint pains. Pain improved with morphine x 1 at outside ED.\n",
