    "input2": "A woman never smoker, with long hx of a disease managed with high dose ranitidine and restrictive diet. She has been on various PPI therapies and Carafate with limited success. Had an endoscopy and biopsies showed no evidence of helicobacter. There was evidence of chemical/reactive gastropathy. She had a 24-hour impedance-pH study performed OFF PPI therapy, which showed an elevated score of 17.2 (normal < 14.7). Esophageal manometry was normal. Referred for consideration of antireflux surgery.\nShe takes Zantac per day, which help, but the symptoms immediately return after the Zantac wears off. She says the heartburn wakes her up at night. She cannot sleep laying flat, must be propped up w/ pillows. Denies regurgitation. Has tried Nexium, which she did not find helpful. She coughs up phlegm in the AM. She notes that over the past months she has been spitting up some blood in the morning when she wakes up. Has a restrictive diet- avoids fruit, caffeine, alcohol, tomato sauce. Denies history of cardiac problems.\n",
