MRI showed extensive white matter disease so on follow up visit with Dr. was consideration of CADASIL, pseudoxanthoma elasticum or COL4 A1 mutation.

NO urinary or bowel changes, no saddle anesthesia, no weakness.\n\ufeff\nThis morning the patient woke with numbness on right outer leg, entire right foot, entire right arm, hand, neck and right face and scalp. +pins and needles. Symptoms have persisted without change through the day. This has never happened before. No weakness, no vision changes, no balance problems, no gait changes. + hiccups for the past few days.\n \nOn neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech. Denies focal weakness. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty\nwith gait.  \n \nOn general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills. No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria.
