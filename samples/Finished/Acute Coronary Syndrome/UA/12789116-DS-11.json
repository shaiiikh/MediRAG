He denies nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. The chest pressure went away after minutes of rest. The patient now feels chest pressure anytime he walks any distance or lifts any object.

His creatinine is elevated from baseline to 1.5 and his troponin was elevated as well. The EW started heparin gtt for ACS. EKG without any ischemic changes. The patient was admitted to cardiology service for further evaluation.  \n\nCurrently, he denies any symptoms and feels well.  \n\nOn review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
