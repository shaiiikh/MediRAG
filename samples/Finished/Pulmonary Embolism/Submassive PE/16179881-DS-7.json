Once at her destination, she remained unable to catch her breath, so she was brought to the hospital by a coworker. She endorses current oral contraceptive use, most recently for 3-month course. She does not have any history of blood clots.\n\ufeff\nWhile in the Emergency Department, the bedside ultrasound of her heart found mild RV dilation, but her troponins and pro-BNP were within normal limits. A CT Angiogram found heavy clot burden in the right pulmonary artery with notable pulmonary artery dilation. Cardiology Team was consulted, and they recommended heparin drip administration, noting lack of indication for EKOS or tPA use.\n\ufeff\nOn the floor, she reports some improvement in her shortness of breath and ability to ambulate around the room - however, she initially struggled with breathing simply when talking, standing up, and changing clothes.
