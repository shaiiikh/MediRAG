She was started on a heparin drip and transferred to the ICU.  Cardiology and Vascular Surgery were consulted.  They recommended therapeutic enoxaparin, which was given.  To assess the strain on the heart, an echocardiogram was performed, which showed right free wall hypokinesis, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and dilation of the right ventricle.\nHeme was consulted, and they recommended lifelong discontinuation of her oral contraceptive pills.  They also advised a six-month course of warfarin.  She underwent a repeat echo, which showed no change.  \nA repeat CTA/CTV of th echest was performed as well as a CT of the pelvis to evaluate thrombus burden and to evaluated for iliofemoral clot, respectively.  A repeat echo was unchanged.  She was put on a regular diet, which she tolerated well.\nShe was advanced to PO pain meds.  Given her experience, she had anxiety, and so social work was consulted to evaluate for therapy options.  From a cardiovascular standpoint, catheter directed thorombolysis was planned for the next morning, so she was switched over to a heparin drip.  \nCatheter directed thrombolysis was attempted but ultimately aborted before tPa was given secondary to her right pulmonary artery pressures being found to be normal.  A repeat echo showed minimal dilation of the ventricle.  She was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  Cardiology recommended 3 weeks of fondaparinux (7.5 mg SC daily) every day with a transition to warfarin as an outpatient.\nShe was doing well and discharged home in stable condition.\n\ufeff\n"
