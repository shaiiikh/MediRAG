She rose from her computer at approximately 9:00 and because lightheaded while walking to the kitchen. She felt that her legs were \"hard as a rock,\" and she bent over to feel her legs. She denies any numbness or tingling at this time. She subsequently lost consciousness and was found by her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 on the floor a few seconds later. During this episode, she experienced central pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath such that she was unable to speak. She was incontinent of urine during this episode. She regained the ability to speak after approximately 30 seconds (of note, she attributes speech deficit to dyspnea rather than confusion or disorientation). She does state that she \"did not feel like myself for hours\" after this episode, though she is unable to elaborate any further. She states that her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 helped her into bed, and she experienced major difficulties in falling asleep despite taking her prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg PRN anxiety.\n\ufeff\nShe states that she awoke (day prior to admission) feeling \"almost normal.\" She continued to experience some dyspnea (of note, at baseline she experiences dyspnea when ascending stairs). On the day of admission, she experienced sudden onset severe pleuritic central chest pain radiating into her back and dyspnea. She phoned and was brought ED for further care.\n\ufeff\nShe has never smoked. She is adopted and thus cannot provide any family history of haematologic disorders.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\n \n+ CT PE Protocol //:\nIMPRESSION:  With evidence of right heart strain\n\ufeff\n#PROVOKED PULMONARY EMBOLISM:\nShe was hemodynamically stable, but initially managed in the CCU with heparin gtt d/t c/f right heart strain. She had a TTE with marked RV dysfunction with septal interaction and there was question of a RA density (not on all views). She ultimately had EKOS directed tPA by interventional radiology with improvement in heart rates and symptoms of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. She had a follow-up echo showing smaller RV and resolution of possible RA echodensity. Her PA systolic pressure and TR was unable to be assessed given EKOS catheter. She had improvement of symptoms of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain and was then transitioned to Xarelto and managed on the medical floor where she remained HDS. She will need follow-up with cardiology and repeat TTE in approximately one month (early. In terms of her risk factors for PE, she participates in \"extreme video gaming\" in which she sometimes is immobile for >12hrs at a time. She has an unknown family history because she was adopted.
