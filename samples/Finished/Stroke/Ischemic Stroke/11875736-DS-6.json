Other history obtained from chart review.\n\ufeff\nPatient was hospitalized after presenting with vertigo and \"shadow-like\" hallucinations and was found to have near-complete occlusion of the right PCA (as well as moderate stenosis of the  distal right M2 and distal right CCA) complicated by acute right PCA territory infarcts (right occipital lone, posterior temporal lobe) with admission neuro exam notable for left homonymous hemianopia but residual deficits were only a left superior temporal quadrantanopia.Work-up at that time, no thrombus. A1c 5.8% and LDL 60.  she was ordered for cardiac monitoring and Rx aspirin 81 mg daily in addition to her atorvastatin 20 mg daily.\nSince her discharge she has had chronic dizziness (lasting the whole day with some lightheaded sensation, blurred vision) and vertigo at times (seems to come when lying down and resting). \nShe reported that her dizziness was worsened by taking all of her medications including her aspirin, losartan, amlodipine and memantine. In the meantime, her PCP reportedly told her to stop taking her losartan given dizziness. \n\ufeff\nShe saw Dr.  who recommended cardiac monitoring because she had not had this done, encouraged aspirin compliance and recommended stopping memantine given ongoing dizziness. \n\ufeff\nShe then presented to the ED for ongoing dizziness and anxiety at which time she had unremarkable labs, utox, stox. Psych consulted and recommended melatonin and trazodone. Neurology was not consulted. She was scheduled to follow-up with her PCP for evaluation of her dizziness. \n\ufeff\nshe has had continued dizziness which is worsened by trazodone. She has had ongoing insomnia and has not been able to sleep except for a few hours at time. She reports a lot of anxiety regarding sleep and her health problems. \"Please do not give me more bad news\". She reports that all of her problems started when she learned her daughter was moving back to japan five months ago and \"I have cried everyday since then\". \n\ufeff\nSeveral days ago she felt that her aspirin was making he extremely anxious so she stopped taking it (has not taken. She went to bed around 11p last night and then woke up at 3:00A feeling very anxious (this is typical for her). However, she noticed that in addition to her usual dizziness, she felt a sensation of spinning and it looked like the pictures on the wall were moving. She had no speech problems, weakness or sensory problems but did feel off balance when walking. She did not fall to a particular side but did feel she had to grab onto the chair to walk. \n\ufeff\nOtherwise, she has had several days of poor appetite. She was also constipated for several days and then took Mylanta yesterday which subsequently made her have two episodes of emesis. She denies fevers, chills, dysuria, abdominal pain, cough or other infectious symptoms. \n \nROS: On further neurologic review of systems, patient has chronic hearing loss (left ear). She denies headaches. Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending speech. Denies dysarthria, or dysphagia. Denies focal muscle weakness, numbness, parasthesia. Denies loss of sensation. Denies bladder incontinence or retention. \n\ufeff\nOn general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, rigors, night sweats, or noticeable weight loss. Denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or cough.  No recent change in bladder habits.  Denies dysuria or hematuria. Denies myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.\n",
