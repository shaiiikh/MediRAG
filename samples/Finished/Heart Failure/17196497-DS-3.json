It is not associated with nausea or diaphoresis and does not feel like his prior MIs. Episodes of chest pressure are typically brought on with exertion although can happen at rest. They are releived with sitting down. When it occurs at rest it improves with burping or a glass of water. He does not take nitro. He does not measure his weight regularly and does not know his dry weight. He denies any increase in swelling, orthopnea. He denies any change in furosemide.
