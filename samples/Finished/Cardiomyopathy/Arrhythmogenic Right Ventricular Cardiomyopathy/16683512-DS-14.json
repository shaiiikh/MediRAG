She reports that the first episode was in early. She had an episode of VT lasting 2 hrs which was hemodynamically tolerated. She was given lidocaine IV and then converted. She was started on sotalol 120mg BID. The second episode was one week later, lasting about 1 hr, then self-terminated. Her sotalol was increased to 160mg po BID and she had no further episodes.  Today, she was sitting in a friend's room when she noted palpitations. This persisted for approximately 2 hrs, prompting her to present to the ED. She converted in the ED waiting room. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness with the rhythm.  \n \nIn the ED, initial vitals were: 98.0 140 141/87 16 100% RA  \n-Labs were notable for: normal labs, K 3.9, Mg 1.8  \n-Pt was given: 1L IVF, potassium 40meq, mg 2g  \n-She was evaluted by cardiology in the ED.
