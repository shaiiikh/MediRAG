There was a proximal-mid diffuse LAD lesion to 60% beginning just before S1. A mildly diseased segment of the mid LAD may have been intramyocardial. There was a very distal apical 75% stenosis (unchanged from previous) before the LAD wrapped around the apex in a terminal bifurcation. The distal diagonals were fairly large and long vessels. Flow in the LAD was slow, consistent with microvascular dysfunction. There were septal collaterals to the\nRPDA.\nLCX: The large high OM1 (functionally a ramus intermedius) had a mild ostial plaque and patent stents. Flow was slightly slow and pulsatile, consistent with microvascular dysfunction. The true AV groove CX was small, diffusely diseased and supplied several small OM and LPL branches, as well as several small atrial branches.\nRCA: The RCA had diffuse disease throughout the mid-distal vessel to 35% mid vessel and 45% in the mid-distal RCA. The prior stent(s) in the distal RCA before the RPDA were patent. The RPDA was subtotally occluded with 99% stenosis at its origin and minimal antegrade filling (TIMI 1), likely the culprit lesion for the current (? recent vs. subacute) NSTEMI. The AV groove RCA just after the RPDA had an 85% stenosis (distal stent edge restenosis) with TIMI 2 pulsatile flow. The RPL1 just beyond this 85% stenosis had an origin 50% stenosis. RPL2 was of modest caliber and diffusely diseased. RPL3 had a laterally oriented sidebranch. The RCA ran well up the lateral aspect of the AV\ngroove.\n"
