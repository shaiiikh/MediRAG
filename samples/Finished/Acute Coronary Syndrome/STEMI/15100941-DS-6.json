LINE PLACEM\nIMPRESSION:  \nIn comparison to radiograph, a right internal jugular central venous catheter is been placed, terminating in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Slight widening of the mediastinum is likely due to accentation of a tortuous thoracic aorta by patient rotation and supine portable technique, but a repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful to confirm this impression when the patient's condition permits.  Lungs are clear except for minor atelectasis at the left lung base. \n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) \nIMPRESSION: \nAs compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, there has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the chest except for slight \nimprovement in minor left basilar atelectasis. \n\nFEMORAL VASCULAR US RIG\nIMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula and the right groin. \n2. Organized hematoma in the right groin measuring up to 7 cm. \n3. No drainable fluid collection. \n  \nCT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.   Infrarenal fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to is 4.7 cm in maximum diameter without evidence of aneurysmal leak, impending or contained rupture.  Recommend follow-up CT at 6 month interval. \n2.   Status post LHC complicated by a right arterial groin bleed.  6.7 x 2.3 cm area of increased density in the anteromedial aspect of right thigh with extensive soft tissue stranding and edema, most consistent with a soft tissue hematoma.  No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. \n3.  Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. \n4.  Focal consolidation of the apex of the left upper lobe, likely related to scarring from chronic parenchymal disease. \n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) \nFINDINGS:  \nCardiomegaly is a stable.  The patient is rotated, this accentuates the widened mediastinum and tortuous aorta.  Improving left lower lobe atelectasis, otherwise the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC\n"
