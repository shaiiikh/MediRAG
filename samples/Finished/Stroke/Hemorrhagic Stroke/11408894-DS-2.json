Patient is semi-reliable historian.\n\ufeff\nHPI: The pt is a right-handed man who presents with 3 days of dysarthria in the setting of hypertensive urgency, nausea/vomiting. He says he \"ate too much.\" Per transfer summary, he came in with abd craming, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and inability to tolerate PO food or medications. His blood sugar was in the 500s and BP 200/80s. He was given IV fluids and his blood sugars were stabilized. He did not have evidence of DKA at that time. He was admitted for evaluation, and had some coffee-ground emesis for which he had endoscopy and was found to have gastritis.\n\ufeff\nOn HD 2 the patient noted that since just prior to his admission his speech has been \"different.\" He says that he is unable to speak at a normal rate and that his speech is no longer \"very good.\" He says that he has difficulty both with coming up with words and with saying them. He says that while he wears dentures occasionally, he is usually able to speak well without them, but now is not able to. He cannot name specific example of his speech difficulty. Per transfer note, his girlfriend confirmed the change in his speech. He says he has never had difficulty speaking prior to this episode.\n\ufeff\nHe also says that he \"can't remember stuff.\" He also notes that from around the time when he began to have difficulty speaking his R hand has felt more numb and clumsy than usual. He normally walks holding a cane in his R hand, but has had trouble holding the cane.\n\ufeff\nevaluate his dysarthria and hand clumsiness, showing a 24mm IPH in the R cerebellum.

No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. \n \nOn general review of systems, the pt complaines of cough, nausea, vomiting/retching. He says that prior to the onset of these symptoms he had felt well and was compliant with his medications. He denies recent fever or chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. No recent change in bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.\n",
