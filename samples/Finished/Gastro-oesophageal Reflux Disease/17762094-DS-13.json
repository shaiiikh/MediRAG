The patient reports that she began to feel increasingly unwell yesterday when she noted increased fatigue and did not leave her home. Today she noted dyspnea and dizziness while walking with her daughter. She had to stop frequently to catch her breath while walking home and had difficulty ambulating up stairs. She also reports difficulty swallowing secondary to throat tightness, with dysphagia to hard solid foods for one month. She has had symptoms like this before, last time one week ago. She sleeps on four pillows nightly due to difficulty breathing. Denies PND. She called EMS for transport to the ED. On arrival to the ED she complaints of chest pain with associated diaphoresis and shortness of breath. In the ED, initial vitals: T 99.6, HR 89, BP 106/60, 98% RA. She was given zofran 2mg IV, ntg sl, tylenol mg, ketorolac 30mg IV. EMS had been concerned about ECG and code STEMI was called. On arrival to ED, ECG was not felt to be consistent with acute ischemia. She underwent a FAST scan which was negative for pericardial effusion. CTA negative for PE or dissection. Her BP dropped to after receipt of SL NTG. She was given 2L NS without response in BP. Her BP improved to after L NS. She reported continued chest pain, which was reproducible upon palpation of the sternum. On arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of continued pain in her chest and throat.\n",
