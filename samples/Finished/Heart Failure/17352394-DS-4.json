No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved. The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is depressed (1.4 cm) consistent with right ventricular systolic dysfunction. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severre global hypokinesis in a pattern most c/w a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Increased PCWP. \n\ufeff\n"
