ECG was unchanged from prior, cardiac enzymes were negative X2. Patient given 325mg ASA. CXR negative for acute process. She underwent CTA which was negative for PE.  \n\nOn admission to the medical floor, the patient reports that she found herself to be hypertensive earlier this afternoon with systolic BP 200s followed by an episode of acute dyspnea. She denied CP, edema, denies cough, fever/chills.
