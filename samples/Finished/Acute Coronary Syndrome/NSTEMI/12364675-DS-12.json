Echo revealed an EF with aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 12 mmHg and a valve area of 0.9cm2. Right heart cath today: Mean Wedge 20mmHG, pulmonary artery pressure 46/21.  Mean aortic gradient 9 mmHg.  Valve area calculated at 2.93.  Left ventriculogram: EF 25%.  Coronary angiography revealed a patent LAD stent with an 80% stenosis immediately after.  Ostial circumflex with a 90% stenosis.  RCA 70% proximal with a chronically occluded right PDA.  A large ramus had a 60% proximal stenosis.  Patient was stable in the ICU and no longer required ICU care. \n\nOf note, there is a report of him having some intermittent confusion and combativeness at home.

They have not been able to put the tube back in due to his current cardiac status. Takes all pills whole in applesauce.
