Procedures involving lengthy exposures to X-rays may cause damage to the skin and/or hair. These adverse effects may be increased if one has had previous (especially recent) radiation exposure to the same skin area. Radiation injury to the skin can take many forms, including an area of redness, blistering, hair loss, or ulceration. These effects may appear after a few weeks or even after several months. If an of these occur on the side and back of the torso (or elsewhere), please contact the Interventional Cardiology Section to arrange further evaluation.\n\nECG:non-ST-elevation\n"
