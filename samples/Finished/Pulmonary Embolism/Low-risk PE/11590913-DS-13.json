She noted no dyspnea at rest, but it was repeatedly exacerbated wtih exertion. She had no precipitating features of stasis such as long plane ride, surgery, or bed ridden state. She had no leg swelling. Her PCP checked Dimer without evidence of R heart strain.On further discussion, she denies frequent miscarraiges though she has never been pregnant save for a single abortion due to fibroids. No family history of blood clots or frequent miscarraiges. No recent trauma to her legs.In the ED, initial vitals: 98.1 18 98% RA.Labs/Studies notable for: Na 130 and K 5.2. She was started on heparin gtt and transferred tothe floor.On arrival to the floor, the patient has no chest pain, no SOB lying still, and otherwise feels her regualr self.
