Less specific: Hypotension, tachycardia (increased heart rate), altered mental status in severe cases.; etc."}, "Pneumonia": "Radiological examination: Chest X-rays or CT scans are the most commonly used methods and can show areas of inflammation in the lungs. On X-ray or CT images, inflammation appears as localized shadows or infiltrative lesions.\nMicrobiological tests: Identification of the causative pathogen can be confirmed through microbial cultures and PCR tests of body fluids such as sputum, blood, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\nComplete blood count (CBC): An increased white blood cell count in the CBC is commonly associated with infection but is not a specific indicator.\nBlood gas analysis: For patients with severe pneumonia, blood gas analysis can help assess oxygenation and acid-base balance.\nC-reactive protein and other inflammatory markers: Levels of these markers typically rise during infections, but they also lack specificity.\n", "Bacterial Pneumonia": "Detection of specific bacteria by PCR or other molecular biology methods.
