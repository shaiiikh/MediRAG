The patient wascooperating with his exercises and doing well; he has shortness of breath at baseline when getting up and walking around, butusually it improves with some rest.  The only thing he noticed before today was some bilateral leg swelling that has since improved.\n\ufeff\nOn the evening of arrival, Pt got up from a couch to go tothe bathroom.  He felt short of breath, more so than usual; hesat back down on the cough, and then - per his wife who saw theevent - he made a \"gurgling\" noise and \"slumped back\" into thesofa.  Pt remembers a feeling of something \"sitting on my chest\" before he lost consciousness.\n\ufeff\nPt estimates that he was unconscious for approximately 5 minutes. His wife said he twitched once, but otherwise had no jerking movements.  Pt thought he was incontinent of a small amount of urine after the event.  He was a little slow to return to normal, but within 20 minutes he was speaking normally with EMT's.  He did not have any tongue biting during the episode.  \n\ufeff\nPt states that he had been taking his enoxaparin until hisprescription ran out (reports 40mg BID at home).  He took it for 10 days after his surgery, and his been off it for approximately weeks.  \n\ufeff\nPatient denies headache, vision changes, cough, runny nose, fever, aches/pains, abdominal pain, bowel habit changes, or dysuria.
