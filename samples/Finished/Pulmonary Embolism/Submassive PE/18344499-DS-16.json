There is no coronary calcification or circumferential pericardial fluid collection. The thoracic aorta looks normal. There is no mediastinal or hilar nodal enlargement. There is a nonocclusive saddle embolism within the right main pulmonary artery. There are occlusive and nonocclusive emboli within right upper, middle, and lower lobe pulmonary arteries. There is also an acute thrombus on the left involving lobar, segmental and subsegmental arteries. Some of these are occlusive. The RV/LV ratio is greater than 1. Despite this there is no reflux of contrast into the IVC or hepatic veins. The visualized portions of the solid organs in the upper abdomen look normal. Incidental note is made of a smalllipoma along the inferolateral aspect of left chest\n\ufeff\nThe lungs are clear. There is minimal right pleural fluid. There is no left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax on either side.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n- TTE: The patient is hemodynamically stable. The left atrial volume index is normal. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional left ventricular systolic function. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 70%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is no mitral valve stenosis. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal with systolic prolapse. There is physiological tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is nopericardial effusion\n\ufeff\n"
