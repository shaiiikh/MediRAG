He was seen 1 week with gross anasarca. At that time, his lasix was increased from 40mg QD to 80mg BID. In the ED initial vitals were: 99.4 95 200/92 18 98% RA. Blood pressure remained 200/90 throughout the ED course. Labs were significant for Cr 3.5, steadily uptrending since ___ (1.3->1.6->2.4->3.2). EKG was consistent with priors (NSR, NANI, no ischemic changes). CXR showed mild pulmonary edema. He was given 40IV lasix with good UOP. Bedside cardiac ultrasound w/mild effusion no evidence of tamponade physiology. Bedside scrotal ultrasound shows fluid, mild hydrocoele, no evidence of vascular compromise (performed by Dr. ___ director). On arrival to the floor he triggered for hypertensive urgency with blood pressure 230/125 c/o headache and photophobia. Neurologic examination was normal at that time. He had not received any BP medications today (missed lisinopril, amlodipine, toprol). Was given IV hydral with good response on the floor.\n",

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %) without regional wall motion abnormalities. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  \nIMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis. Severe LV diastolic dysfunction. Mild pulmonary hypertension.\n"
