He was at work at the time; he does have manual labor associated with the job. He noticed that the right arm and leg was weak, as he was having difficulty doing motor tasks with the right hand. He could walk, but had difficulty using his  right leg due to weakness. He was unable to drive home due to his weakness, which prompted him to go to ED. Since onset of symptoms, he reports they have waxed and waned, but generally are unchanged overall.  No progression of symptoms. \n\ufeff\nThe patient for which he is followed by a neurologist (Dr. He currently is not on any therapy for this. He was on injectibles for some time, then switched to Tecfidera about 5 years ago. He self-discontinued the Tecfidera one year ago due to facial flushing/swelling. He reports that when he saw his neurologist in follow up, he said the medication was not needed at this time. He says his typical flares are characterized by right hand weakness and sensory changes. Currently, his right hand symptoms are similar to his typical flare, but the right leg is new. \n\n",
