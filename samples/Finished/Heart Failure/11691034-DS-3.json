There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the mid to distal left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 35___. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n"
