She has a h/o RRMS diagnosed first with an episode of L-sided optic neuritis. However, retrospectively she had an episode of decreased visual acuity and difficulty walking and drove herself to the hospital only to fall out of the car semiconcious at the hospital doors. She has not had a flare years. In total she has had 4 clinical episodes during this time, averaging approximately every 18 months. She describes her episodes as beginning with decreased appetite and weight loss progressing to difficulty walking and blurried vision. During her episodes she becomes wheelchair bound, although between episodes she describes her walking as completely normal and feels that she even walks faster than most people. Her vision in her L eye recovered after her first two flares, but she is now only able to see shadows out of her L eye. She reports that flares always happen in the winter. Since her diagnosis Ms. has been taking Avonex full dose (30 mcg weekly). Her medication was changed to Tysabri and she stopped the Avonex. \n.\nThis particular flare began approximately weeks prior to admission when Ms. noticed that her walking was slowing. She also began noticing an intense burning pain extending from below her breasts symmetrically down her torso and both of her legs to the bottom of her feet. She was taking Aleve twice a day with improvement in the pain. This pain is a new symptom that she has not had with previous flares - at least not to this extent. She noticed that her knees felt week two days prior to admission and on the day prior to admission she was wheelchair bound. At the time of presentation she reports that she is able to walk a bit better with her walker. \n.\nOf note, Ms. reports that her best friend died of colon cancer 5 weeks prior to presentation. In addition, Ms. one episode of vertigo which lasted a full day one month prior to admission for which she was not evaluated. She also has noticed increased urinary urgency, whichshe believes is due to drinking more fluids and difficulty getting to the bathroom in the last few days. She has not had a bowel movement in 4 days, which is not normal for her. At baseline, she has electrical sensations in the base of her head and neck at baseline worse with neck flexion (Lhermitte's phenomenon). She describes generalized painful electrical sensations in her lower extremities bilaterally.  She generally suffers from low energy and has difficulty sleeping through the night.\n.\nReview of systems: No difficulty in speech, comprehension, change in  hearing, change in behavior, or history of trauma.  No fever, rhinorrhea, cough, SOB, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or rash.\n",
