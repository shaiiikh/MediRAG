Neurology consulted for evaluation of TIA.\n\ufeff\nHe reports woke up in his usual state of health this morning which includes complete independence in all ADLs. Around 7:30 he was typing in the computer when he had acute onset numbness, which he initially noted in his hand. He reports had the sensation that his hand fell asleep and became \"leaden\". He could not use the computer's mouse as the hand was heavy and would fall on it. He felt somewhat lightheaded, so he stood up and noticed his entire RT side felt numb and heavy with the exception of his face. He walked out to the hallway and noticed was limping with his RT leg and felt he would collapse. At that point he called his girlfriend to come pick him up to take him to urgent care.  He denies any trouble with his speech or swallowing and reports she understood everything that he said. While he waited he tried to play the guitar and noticed he was not able to hold the pick, however he thinks that after several tries he started improving. He estimates the symptoms lasted for a total of thirty minutes.  Denies any visual symptoms such as visual loss, double, or \nblurry vision. He denies facial numbness, tingling, or ringing in his ears.

He denies neck pain since. He also reports had a recent check up with his PCP who told him he was in \"great shape\".     \n\ufeff\nOn neurologic review of systems, other than the above mentioned symptoms the patient denies headache or confusion. Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending speech. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia. Denies bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. \n\ufeff\nOn general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, rigors, night sweats, or noticeable weight loss. Denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or cough. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  Denies dysuria or hematuria.
