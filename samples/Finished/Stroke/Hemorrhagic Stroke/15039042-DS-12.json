The grandson noted that the patient couldn't use her walker at all secondary to weakness after the third fall. Son arrived and picked patient up off floor. Noted L sided weakness and called EMS. Left facial droop was noted but this was this is somewhat confounded by an old bells palsy. At ___, serial head CTs demonstrated worsening R intraparenchymal bleed. She was sent here for further care.  She was admitted to the TSICU and was noted to be increasingly drowsy and a CT head was done this morning which showed worsening from previous CT.  \n",
