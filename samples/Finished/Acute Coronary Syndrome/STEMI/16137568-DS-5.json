She also described radiation to the jaw on both sides, as well as radiation to the back. This discomfort was waxing and waning and was not associated with exertion, but became persistent the night prior to presentation. It was not associated with any nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis. She does endorse mild shortness of breath, and states that last week when she was on vacation she was also feeling short of \nbreath after ambulating long distances. All of the symptoms are totally new for her.\n\ufeff\nGiven the fact that her discomfort became persistent, she decided to present to the emergency room. Labs were notable for a troponin T of 0.14, normal CBC, initial EKG with nonspecific ST changes. She was given sublingual nitro with help with her chest discomfort, as well as full dose aspirin and ticagrelor 180. Subsequent EKG showed ST elevations \n\ufeff\nHer chest pain had improved. Per verbal sign out, in the Cath Lab, she initially underwent right radial approach and had findings consistent with RCA with a subtotal occlusion that appeared chronic and calcified with sluggish flow distally. Her left-sided circulation showed a 60% stenosis of her obtuse marginal, and an LAD with no significant disease but moderate calcifications. Her access had to be switched to right groin because of a short and tortuous aorta. The operator was unable to wire the RCA lesion successfully because of likely chronic nature and calcifications. Given that she was chest pain-free and her EKG had improved, no further intervention was pursued. She was brought to the CCU with a plan to potentially return to the Cath Lab later this morning for CTO procedure.\n\ufeff\nOn arrival to the CCU, She is comfortable, cheerful, and chest pain-free. Her husband is at bedside.\n\ufeff\nROS: Positive per HPI. Remaining 10 point ROS reviewed and negative.\n",
