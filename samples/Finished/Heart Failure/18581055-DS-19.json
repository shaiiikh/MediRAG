His weight has varied from 165 - 172 and his BNP seems at baseline to be 220-250. On day prior to admission he weight was167 and BNP was 916. Cr was 1.5 from a baseline of 1.2-1.6.

CXR showed showed congestive heart failure with moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral effusions. proBNP was 8317. He was observed for aggressively diuresed and urine output monitoring. At Cardiology evaluated and recommended another 120 mg IV lasix w/ MeQ KCL x 1 now with a plan to be discharged on torsemide 40 mg (20 mg x 2) qam, and OFF lasix and have close follow-up. Urine output was ~2.25 L/20 hours and the patient reportedly was feeling better.\n\ufeff\nOn transfer to the floor, vitals were 98.1 62 160/70 18 99% RA. In the initial workup, however, blood cultures were drawn that returned successfully diuresed. However as part of initial workup, a set of blood cultures were drawn that grew GPC in clusters in both the aerobic and anaerobic bottles. A second set of blood cultures were drawn and are currently pending. His lactate also rose from 1.7 on initial draw prior to diuresis to 3.3 this afternoon.\n\ufeff\nReportedly, he denied any infectious symptoms. His urine was negative, and CXR without infiltrate.
