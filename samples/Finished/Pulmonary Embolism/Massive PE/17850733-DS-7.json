Of note he had his tunnel catheter dialysis line was exchanged secondary to flow difficulties/obstruction at hemodialysis. In the ED he had a CTA which showed small subsegmental PE in LLL. Given h/o allergy to heparin, he was started on agatroban. In the ED he was given zofran 4 mg IV/morphine 2 mg IV/ASA 600 mg PR/lopressor 5 mg IV/ Plavix 300 mg xT. I spoke with his daughter last night who confirmed that we should continue the agatroban and she would be open to the idea of coumadin. He has not had any falls. Dr. was also in agreement with this.
