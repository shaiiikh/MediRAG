One week ago, the patient developed R chest pain and SOB. She saw NP associated with her PCP's office where she complained of right sided thoracic back pain and pleuritic chest pain. She recommended a CTA chest, CXR and was also given Augmentin 875mg BID for possible infection, and analgesia with ibuprofen and tylenol #3. Chest x-ray was also done which showed dense right lung base opacity with associated effusion. Prior authorization was obtained and the patient obtained CTA chest 3 days later. The CTA showed multiple PEs with a possible area of necrosis, so she was referred for further management. There she was found to have O2 sat 88% RA. A bedside ultrasound showed no ultrasound evidence of pericardial effusion, and normal cardiac activity. Troponin was 0.156. Of note, LFTs were performed and notable for new transaminitis (AST 47 ALT 74) and elevated alk phos 267.\n\n",

The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 67%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\n"
