She uses a manual wheelchair, and has become more dependent on this over time as she has become less mobile. In fact, over the past month, she has not been able to stand at all. The greatest impact of this is on her bathroom use; she was previously able to transfer the wheelchair to the toilet and stand to get her pants off and on, but has been unable to do this for the past month. She has also been falling at home; last fall was yesterday evening (she fell off the bed when trying to use a slide board; she says she can't lift her left leg up high enough to use the board; no head strike). She was previously well attended to by her husband, but since he suffered from a stroke, he has been unable to care for her.    \n\ufeff\nNeuro ROS: Positive for lower extremity weakness as per HPI. She is unable to ambulate. She noted that she has had spasticity previously, but this has improved since starting Baclofen. She also notes occasional difficulty with fine motor movements; she describes difficulty writing and with buttons. No headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. No difficulties producing or comprehending speech. She notes intermittent parasthesias of her fingertips. She is incontinent because of her difficulty getting to the bathroom in time, but she is able to recognize when she needs to go to the bath room and it does not seem that urgency is a problem. \n\nIn the ED she said her symptoms had subsided and her condition had returned to a stable state. She said similar situations had happened before.\n  \n \nGeneral ROS: No fever or chills. No cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, palpitations. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria. No rash. Denies rash. She does note that she does not drink or eat a lot because of her difficulty with going to the bathroom.\n",
