Earlier today he was walking with his wife when he noted substernal chest pain that was relieved by rest. He has angina, but he did not have chest pain to this magnitude in the past. He was able to go home where Nitro SL provided some relief. He reported some nausea, but no jaw pain, shoulder pain, diaphoresis or emesis. The chest pain persisted and he presented to the ED.  \n\nOf note his last Cath  demonstrated 90% focal mid/distal LAD setnosis of a twin LAD. 90% LCX and serioal stenosis of the RCA. He has not had any stents placed.  He had no intervention from his last Cath.  \n\nOn review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  \n\nIn the ED, his vital signs were 97.2 71 BP 194/95 14 100% RA. He was given the following medications: ASA 81 mg x 3, SL nitro x 3, strated on nitro gtt, and heparin drip. He was also given IV morphine.  \n\nOn the floor, he had additional chest pain that was relieved when the nitro gtt was uptitrated. At the time of this interview his chest pain was minimal.\n",
