The sensation is heavy or numb feeling (not pain without any objective loss of sensations) It started at the same time. It gradually creeped up upto both knees circumferentially in 10 days. Initially she noticed this sensation more in the evenings when she was relxing at home. However over last days its progressed over to involve her thighs upto belly button and is nearly constant. She has developed tight band like sensation around belly button area especially on the left side which is intermittent. she has noticed tight feeling in hamstrings and calfs on both sides also over last few days. No weakness or difficluty walking. No bladder bowel issues. No trauma to spine, no similar complains in the past. she had H1n1 vaccine, no recent travels or sick contacts. In the ED she said her symptoms had subsided and her condition had returned to a stable state. She said similar situations had happened before.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n",
