He says that he was in his usual state of health until 4 days ago when he had a string of \"4 barbeques\" in a row and ate \"all the bad things\", including hot dogs, cheeseburgers, sausages and other tasty salty snacks. He states that over the last 4 days he has had an insidious increase in his shortness of breath, to the point where he could not walk or otherwise exert himself without becoming short of breath. He attempted some of his wife's supplemental oxygen with improvement in shortness of breath. He tried 80mg PO of lasix (20mg above his usual dose of 60mg daily) to no avail. He endorses a progressively worsening dry cough, but denies any edema, weight gain, fevers/chills, or chest pain/pressure.\n",
