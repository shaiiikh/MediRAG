Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional \nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\ufeff\nIMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild ischemic mitral regurgitation. \n\ufeff\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed), regional LV systolic dysfunction is new. Finding discussed with Dr. at 1043 hours on the day of the study.   \n\ufeff\nCardiovascular Report Stress Study Date \nIMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or additional ST segment changes from baseline. Appropriate hemodynamic response to the Persantine infusion. \nNuclear report sent separately. \n\ufeff\nCARDIAC PERFUSION PHARM Study Date\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  No reversible perfusion defect. \n2.  Severe fixed basal and mid inferior wall defect.  Mild fixed inferolateral wall defect. \n3.  Inferior and septal wall hypokinesis. \n4.  LVEF 36% and moderate LV enlargement.\n\ufeff\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date  7:15 AM \nSevere cardiomegaly is stable. Mild pulmonary edema is \nminimally increased.  The left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated.  There are bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral effusions.\n"
