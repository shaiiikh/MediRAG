Chem7, CBC, and remaining LFTs were unremarkable (AP 117, Tbili 0.4, Alb 4.7, Lipase 28. Urine culture was sent, though UA was bland. Patient was given Zofran, dilaudid, promethazine, donnatal, viscous lidocaine, Aluminum-Magnesium Hydrox.-Simethicone. Thoracic surgery was consulted and did not see an indication for further thoracic involvment. Patient requested admission for symptoms and so the ED obliged. Vitals on Transfer: 98.3 100 122/87 14 96% RA. \nOn the floor patient reports epigastric and chest pain, worse with coughing fits. \n\nReview of sytems: \n(+) Per HPI \n(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest tightness, palpitations. No dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
