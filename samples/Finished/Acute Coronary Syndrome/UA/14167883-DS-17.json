The patient exercised for 5 minutes of a Modified protocol and was stopped for fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 3.8, which represents a poor exercise tolerance for her age. There were no reports of chest, back, neck, or arm discomforts during the study. Dyspnea was noted throughout exercise which improved during recovery. There were no significant ST segment changes noted during exercise or early recovery. After 3 minutes of recovery, the facility lost power and EKGs were not acquired for the remainder of the study. Rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated VPBs and rare isolated APBs. The heart rate response was appropriate during exercise and recovery. Mild resting hypertension with an appropriate blood pressure response to exercise. \nIMPRESSION: Poor functional capacity. No anginal type symptoms \nor ischemic EKG changes. Mild resting hypertension. Echo report sent separately. \nThe patient exercised for 5 minutes and 0 seconds according to a \nModified treadmill protocol METS) reaching a peak heart rate of 139 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 206/82 mmHg. \nThe test was stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise represents a poor exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details). There is resting hypertension. There were normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to stress. \nResting images were acquired at a heart rate of 74 bpm and a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. These demonstrated normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrated no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient. \nEcho images were acquired within 45 seconds after peak stress at heart rates of 136 - 116 bpm. These demonstrated new regional dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the mid- and distal segments of the anterior wall, septum as the apex (mid-LAD territory). The remaining segments augment appropriately. There was augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. \n\ufeff\nIMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity. Non-diagnostic ECG changes. 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ishemia in the LAD territory at achieved workload. Resting hypertension.\n"
