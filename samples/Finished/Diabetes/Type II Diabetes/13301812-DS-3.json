She found that sugary foods relieved her symptoms. On the morning or admission she went to work and after feeling diaphoretic, decided to go to the ED, vitals were 95.5, 88 127/68 16, 100%RA, and was found to have a FSBG of 72. She had a meal and FSBG increased to 100. Several hours later her sugar decreased to 29 and was given more Dextrose as well as Octreotide 75mcg SC for presumed Sulfonylurea-related hypoglycemia and was transferred to the MICU for further observation and management of her hypoglycemia.  .  \nWhile in the MICU the patient was kept for a period of time and all her oral anti-hypoglycemics were discontinued. Her hypoglycemia improved and she has had no further episodes of hypoglycemia during this admission. Given that her oral anti-hyperglycemic agents have been discontinued, her blood sugars have been somewhat labile, peaking at 434, however, her sugars have responded to coverage w/an insulin sliding scale. Now asymptommatic, eating a regular diet and re-started on Metformin, she is stable and ready to be transferred to the general medical floor.  \n\ufeff\n",
