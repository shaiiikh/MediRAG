He does not recall the small accident because he lost consciousness.  There is concern for possible seizure when EMS arrived due to the fact that he was minimally responsive and had lost his urine in the car as well as had a tongue bite.  He was taken to hospital where he was given 1 mg of Ativan and Keppra.  He underwent head CT which showed a 1.8 x 2.2 cm hyperdense lesion in the right parietal lobe concerning for intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  There was surrounding edema and mild mass-effect but no midline shift.  The decision was made to transfer to ICU for further management.\n\ufeff\nOf note, patient has a history of 2 lifetime seizures prior to this episode, both of which were in the context of alcohol withdrawal.
