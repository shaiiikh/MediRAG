There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with no more than borderline-mild global hypokinesis (suboptimal image quality). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n"
