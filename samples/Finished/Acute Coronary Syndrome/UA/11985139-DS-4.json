The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
