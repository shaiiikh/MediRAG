Headaches frsit began months ago, and are described as diffuse \"pressure\" associated with intermittent left sided blurry vision or visual sensations (crossing lines), sometimes also with nausea.   She also had not had a menstrual cycle and recently went to OBGYN for workup where she was found with elevated prolactin to 47 which responded to progesterone challenge.  As part of that workup she was sent for MRI which revealed a 2.8x 2.2 cm mass with left sided optic nerve compression. \n\ufeff\nShe was referred where she had endorcrine workup and a cosyntropin test which returned normal.  She had formal visual field testing as well but does not know the results.  Referred to us today for assessment of potential resection.\n",
