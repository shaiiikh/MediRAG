The pain would come and go, was pressure and stinging like in sensation, pain at its worst, was associated with SOB, diaphoresis, nausea, and arm tingling. Although this pain was similar to his cardiac chest pain during his last heart attack, he thought it was indigestion and treated it at home with Tums. He also had an associated sore throat for which he visited his PCP. He did not endorse chest pain at the time and did not have an ECG or cardiac workup. Today, he called his PCP again, endorsed chest pain, He tried SL nitro x 1 at home without relief. He initially presented to hospital where he was treated with ASA 324 and GI cocktail. His ECG revealed new ST depressions and trop-I was elevated to 3.23. He was given Lovenox , \n\ufeff\ninitial vitals were: 98.6 83 146/78 16 96%. ECG was significant for ST depressions in the lateral leads. Labs were significant for an elevated troponin of 0.41 and normal CBC/chem7. He was treated with metoprolol, nitro gtt, dilaudid, and was sent to the cath lab where a DES was placed to his LCX. After the procedure he continued to have chest pain and ECG changes so was started on an Eptifibatide gtt and admitted to the CCU. \n\ufeff\nUpon arrival to the floor,  he continued to complain of chest pain. He was treated with SL nitro with relief to pain. A second SL NTG resulted in reduction to pain. A nitroglycerin drip was started.\n",
