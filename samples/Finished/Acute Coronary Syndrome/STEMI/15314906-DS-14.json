No associated symptoms. Pain was not positional, not worsened with exertion or taking a deep breath, denies any specific aggravating factors. Initially improved with having a bowel movement. This pain then recurred 1h later and pateint decided to go to the ED. Denies prior hx. chest pain, denies new swelling in his legs, no orthopnea. Is fairly active, denies recent exertional chest pain.  \n \nPatient originally presented with these complaints where where he was found to have elevated troponint to 0.11 and ECG changes w/ STD V2-V4 and less than 0.5mm STE inferiorly which normalized after treatment with nitro. There he was given GI cocktail, full dose aspirin, nitro, and started on a heparin drip after which patient was chest pain free. Patient was also given ASA prior to transfer and eval'ed to BI admission w/ plan for cath. On arrival to ED, patient stated that his discomfort was down from initially.  \n \nIn the ED initial vitals were: 99.4 68 144/90 16 99% RA.  \n - Labs were significant for trop t 0.17, PTT 105 (prior CBC and chem-7 @ unremarkable)  \n - Patient was continued on heparin gtt and nitro gtt, as was given ativan x1.  \nOn the floor patient overall feels well, says having chest pain, much improved from prior.
