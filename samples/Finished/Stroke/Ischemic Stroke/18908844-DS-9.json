No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium. The left atrial appendage is not visualized. The right atrium is mildly enlarged. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional left ventricular systolic function. No thrombus or mass is seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 50-55%. Left ventricular cardiac index is low normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with\nnormal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. There is significant pulmonic regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/vegetation are seen on the tricuspid valve. There is mild to moderate [___] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic PR velocity is elevated suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a prominent anterior fat pad.\n"
