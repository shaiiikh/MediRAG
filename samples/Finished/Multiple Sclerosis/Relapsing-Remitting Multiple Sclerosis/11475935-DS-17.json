He denies any focal weakness but feels generalized weakness. He has more difficulty with climbimg up stairs tahn going down. He also noticed he has been more clumsy with his hands but he denies weakness; he can hold objects without problems. He thinks his gait issues have been slowly getting worse and that he lost his job because of his condition. He reports that 1 week ago he woke up with a left temporal headache, throbbing with no photo or phonophobia or nausea alongwith blurry vision on left eye (he did close one eye at a time). He usually does not have headaches and this one lasted for about 3 days. His vision did not improve. He was seen by Opththalmology yesterday abnormality was found that would explain his blurry vision (formal note is pending). He comes to ER today for neurologic evaluation. He denies urinary or bowel incontinence. In the ED he said his symptoms had subsided and his condition had returned to a stable state. He said similar situations had happened before.\n\n",
