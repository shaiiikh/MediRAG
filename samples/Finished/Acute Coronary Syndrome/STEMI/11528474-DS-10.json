    "input2": "Patient was in his usual state of health today, but did note some discomfort in his left shoulder while he was at the gym. He says his discomfort has been going on for a few weeks, and he has been attributing it to a musculoskeletal injury from working out. The pain subsided after working out at the gym, and he subsequently went to work. At some point later in the morning at work, he developed sudden onset dizziness, sweating, and chest pain that he described as \"knifelike\". He became so uncomfortable that he \"could not speak\". His wife, who works in the same office as him, called ___. He also had one episode of vomiting.\n\nHe was brought to cath lab where he had total occlusion of LAD. 3 DES (2.5mmx15mm, 3mmx15mm, 3.5mmx15mm) placed in LAD. There was no reflow which minimally responded to intracoronary agents. Given ongoing angina and poor flow in LAD, he was started on an IABP in addition to IV eptifibitide and IV heparin. Given 180 mcg of 325 mg, and 4000U heparin. Subsequently transferred here for further workup and management.\n\nVitals prior to transfer 138/77 w O2 sats 99% on 4L NC.\n\nOn arrival to the CCU, patient was having persistent chest pain and nausea. He was started on a nitro drip with little relief. His EKG showed worsening ST elevations, and the decision was made to bring him to the cath lab. In our Cath Lab his balloon pump was removed and replaced with an Impella via the right groin. His LVEDP went from ___ after balloon placement. Per verbal sign out from the Cath Lab, the stents placed earlier in the day appeared patent but there was residual disease distal to them. Ultimately 2 additional stents were placed in the LAD. Angiography of the LAD revealed TIMI III flow, 0% residual, occluded diagnoal branch likely due to pre-existing dissection, but no dissection in the LAD proper. \n\nHe also had another stent placed in his OM1 which was 95% occluded. Final angiography of the OM revealed TIMI III flow, 0% residual, and no dissection. He received about 1 L of IV fluid in the Cath Lab, as well as 210 cc of contrast.\n\nUpon return to the CCU, his Impella was noted to be properly placed on bedside ultrasound, and his chest pain had improved.\n\nLABS NOTABLE FOR: WBC 10.9 HGB 15.4 PLT GLC 126\n\nROS: Positive per HPI.
