History is gathered from the patient's two daughters, as he is too obtunded to give a history.  Per his daughters, he had been experiencing increasing CP all week since being discharged from rehab.  Has had multiple episodes of chest pain that came on with both rest and exertion, as well as while sitting on the toilet trying to have BM. Associated with diaphoresis and radiation of pain to left arm. Episodes lasted less than an hour usually and were relieved with multiple doses of nitro.  He also was complaining of worsening shortness of breath, which became signficantly worse last night.  Has been sleeping sitting up in a chair, becomes dyspneic and has chest pain when lying flat.  Daughters also endorse PND and worsening lower extremity edema. \n\ufeff\nGiven all these symptoms, his daughters have called a few times this week, but thus far the patient had refused to go.  Today they mentioned his symptoms at a pre-op visit for CABG planning, and they were told to call their cardiologist, who recommended they bring him to the ER.  They brought him to hospital, where he was tachypneic and tachycardic, so he was started on BiPAP.  Nitro paste was applied, resulting in hypotension, so paste was removed.  Cardiac enzymes at that time were negative and ECG showed baseline LVH with \"strain\" pattern. Given that his providers were and he is scheduled to undergo CABG here next week, he was transferred to ED via med-evac flight.  While en route he started to not tolerate the BiPAP, was given ativan 2mg IV, and subsequently became obtunded. \nOn arrival to hospital, initial vitals were HR: 99, BP: 179/70, and \nhis GCS was 7, he was satting 90% on NRB.  He was switched back onto BiPAP given his belly breathing, poor breath sounds at bases with crackles. He was started low dose nitro gtt with drop in pressures again, so this was stopped.  No lasix was given in the ED. Labs and imaging significant for Trop negative, CK: 37  MB: 2, Lactate:2.3, CXR showing volume overload from comparision 12 hours ago. \n   \nOn arrival to the floor, patient was on BiPAP, sedative and minimally responsive, GCS 12.\n",
