She presented to the ED with days of dizziness, malaise, and increased seizure activiy. \n\nMuch of the history was obtained via her daughter who is her primary caretaker. She remember first feeling poorly and attributes her symptoms to starting clonidine. She noted a dry mouth and loss of appetite. She noted increased seizure activity. Specifically she usually has 1, focal, LUE seizure per month. She noted seizures (all LUE, focal seziures with no generalized features). She was tired and did not feel like getting out of bed. She had a pre-syncopal event and almost fell after standing up (SBP at that time 154 per her daughter via home BP machine). She continued to feel tired, occasional dizziness, and had poor appetite with loss of taste and anorexia so she presented to the ED. \n\nThroughout these episodes her BG was normal on a number of occasions. She also had no urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, fevers, chills, or focal neuro symptoms.\n\nVital signs on arrival: T 98.1, P 60, BP 164/80, 97% RA. Her evaluation in the ED was notable for normal orthostatic, a sodium of 149, Cr of 1.5, INR 5.1, and normal head CT. In the ED she received 1 L of D5W.\n\nROS: as above. In addition, she had constipation that resolved with laxitives over the weekend. Other systems reviewed in detail and all otherwise negative.\n",
