She was in a car accident two weeks ago, where she was driving in an intersection and got T-boned by another vehicle coming from the left. She does not relate that she was aware that the other car was coming. She did hit her head at this time against a window which shattered, and injured her left shoulder. She went to an OSH and got a head CT, with no traumatic injury, however with abnormality R parietal area. Follow up MRI with mainly white matter lesion in the right parietal area, although going into the gray matter a bit, and was sent here for further evaluation.\n\nHere, she denies any health issues, and review of systems is negative. She denies falling, bumping into things. Her husband denies this as well and states that she has been acting the same as usual. No weight loss, and no fevers/chills.

Volumetric data was also acquired through the head and neck following the uncomplicated administration of intravenous contrast and collimated at 1.25 mm slice thickness.  3D maximum intensity projections of the head and neck were provided.

No other area of hypodensity is identified.  There is no evidence of midline shift, mass effect, hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collections. The ventricles, sulci and basal cisterns are otherwise normal.  There is mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus.  Mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are otherwise clear.   \n  \nCTA Head:  The intracranial internal carotid arteries demonstrate calcified and noncalcified plaque, particularly within the cavernous segments.  However, there is no evidence of high-grade narrowing.  The bilateral middle cerebral, anterior cerebral, posterior to the prevertebral, basilar and posterior cerebral arteries demonstrate adequate opacification.  There is relative paucity of a vasculature in the region of the described right parietal lobe infarct.  The anterior communicating artery is not definitely visualized.  The posterior communicating arteries are well seen. There is no evidence of high-grade stenosis, aneurysm or dissection. \n"
