    "input2": "He is a man with HLD, who presents with <1 day of acute chest pain.  \nThe chest pain woke him from sleep at 4 AM the day of presentation, and lasted one hour. He describes the pain as feeling like someone was pushing their forearm against his mid-chest. The pain was associated with diaphoresis and a mild headache. The pain is worse with lying flat, improved sitting up. There was no dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or radiation, and he has had no recent illnesses or URI symptoms. He took a Zantac and Advil, which improved his symptoms but they did not completely resolve. The chest pain continued throughout the day. He shares that the day before he had lifted weights and had a heavy dinner, and did not have chest pain during either. He has never had chest pain or pressure before. He occasionally has heart burn after eating certain foods, but never has had heart burn with exertion, and his symptoms this time were very distinct.  \nIn the ED initial vitals were: T 97.1 HR 89 BP 138/79 Resp 19 98% RA. Cr 1, Hb 16.2, Platelet 176, INR 1.1, PTT 30.7. Initial EKG: Initial: rate 83, NSR left axis deviation, no ischemic changes. Second EKG: rate 84, NSR, left axis deviation, worsened STD in V2-V3. Third EKG: rate 86, NSR, LAD STD in AVR, V1, V2 with mild ST elevation in V4-V6. CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process. He was given a full dose aspirin, SL nitroglycerin, and IV heparin. \nCardiology was consulted and he was taken to the cath lab. A DES was placed in the proximal LCX. He was loaded with Plavix.  \nUpon arrival to the floor, the patient gives the above history. He is currently chest pain free. He reiterates that he has never had symptoms like this before. He exercises a few times per week and always feels well. He has no history of presyncope/syncope,orthopnea, PND, or leg swelling.  \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nOn further review of systems, denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.\n",
