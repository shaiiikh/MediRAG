At that point was given glucagon. \n\ufeff\nHas significant number of prior admissions for nausea/vomitting attributed to gastroparesis--per PCP usually episodes are set off by life stressors. Current stressors include her mother moving to an apartment farther away with inconvenient transportation. Her year old son is having difficulty in school due to ADHD diagnosis. Lives alone but is very close to her mother. Previously has had self-motivation to take charge of own care, but recently has required increasing degree of intervention from Social Worker. Seen a week ago and per PCP had more distant affect.\n\ufeff\nThis AM took her insulin 70/30 at 28 units as prescribed and proceeded to get ready fro appointment to have stitches removed that had been placed after last fall. Felt nauseated and did not eat--otherwise no symptoms of hypoglycemia.  No increase in polyuria, no frank vomitting, no diarrhea. No prodrome before she blacked out. Found by sister who called for ambulance. EMS found her to have FSG of 50. At that point was given glucagon. Currently complains of R sided chest wall pain and R flank pain, unchanged from pain she was experiencing upon presentation to the ED 3 days prior, CXR and rib films at that time negative. \n\ufeff\nIn the ED, initial vital signs were 97.4 110 143/93 18 98% \nPatient was given.  Pt having nausea and vomitting, so received 4mg iv zofran, 4mg po zofran, 10mg reglan and 1mg iv ativan. She received 0.5mg iv dilaudid for her chronic pain. Was tachy to 120's, on the monitor at times, but is coming down with ivf. her bp is high but pt has not been taking her meds, gave her am dose of amlodipine today. \n\ufeff\n",

On amlodipine and lisinopril at home which patient has been complaint. Has missed her BP meds on day of admission.Prior symptomatic hypotension so would be careful about giving too much BP meds.
