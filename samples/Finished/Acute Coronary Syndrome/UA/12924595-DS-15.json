The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Bony structures appear within normal limits. \n \n___ ECHO:\n\nFindings   \nLEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes. \n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF>55%). Estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral Doppler E>A and TDI E/e' <8 suggesting normal diastolic function, and normal LV filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). \n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. \n\nAORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels. \n\nAORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. \n\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.  Normal mitral valve supporting structures.\n\n___ VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial \nTR. Normal PA systolic pressure. \n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.   \nConclusions   \n The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 60 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular regional/global systolic \nfunction. Normal left ventricular diastolic function with normal \nleft ventricular enddiastolic pressure.\n\nECG:non-ST-elevation\n"
