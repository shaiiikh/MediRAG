Specifically, on day 1, his score was 32.8, however, on day 2 it was 8.9.  There were three reports of abdominal pain over these two days.  The symptom index was 33% and the symptom association probability was 70%. Dr. the results of the Bravo test.  There were veryfew episodes of abdominal pain and this may in part reflect thelow symptom association probability. The patient has abnormal reflux and by objective measures he would be a candidate for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.

Patient decided that he wanted to go ahead with the surgery and presents today.\n",
