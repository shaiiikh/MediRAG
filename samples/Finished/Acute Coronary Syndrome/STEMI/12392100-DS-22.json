He has been a lifelong heavy drinker and smoker, but he's been drinking far more than usual and at atypical times of day. He's also had erratic behavior including spending all his time naked, being incontinent of urine and sometimes stool, shouting sporadically and playing loud music, and other behavior that is very atypical for him. He was recently hospitalized for a rectal foreign body that was removed successfully. Due to concern for behavioral changes and rapidly progressive dementia, neurology was consulted. They suggested an extensive neurologic workup but the patient left AMA. He has since established with neurology but has also declined a workup there. \n\nHe was having a typical day, and drinking heavily during the day. His wife made him a sandwich and left the room briefly and returned when she heard gurgling sounds. She found him to have jerking movements of his extremities and not responding to her. She called EMS who arrived within minutes and found him to be pulseless VF and delivered a shock, regaining a pulse. He was intubated in the field. He received an amiodarone bolus. He was given 600mg aspirin PR. \n\nOn arrival, there is observed to be anterior ST elevations. Angiography showed 95% LM ostial stenosis, 90% LAD extending to mid-LAD and 90% stenosis at large diagonal. the circumflex has 80% mid stenosis. The RCA had minimal disease. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed using R femoral access. \n\nOn arrival for to the ICU, he was found to not be following commands and post-arrest was consulted who recommended targeted-temperature management and EEG.He is a gentleman with CAD (known occluded RCA with collaterals s/p PCI's (PTCA and stenting of ostial LCx and PTCA ostial RI c/b instent restenosis at ostium of LCx and restenosis of ramus branch s/p PTCA of LCx ostium and ramus ostium, HTN, HL, chronic low back pain and anxiety who presented to OSH with chest pain. He was found to have an NSTEMI and was transferred to for catheterization.\n  \nAt the time of presentation, patient's pain was in severity. Troponins initially .06, repeat troponin at 8:20AM day of transfer, 0.25. VS on transfer: 136/59, HR 69 SR, 16, 97% 2 liters, afebrile.  Patient arrived and underwent uncomplicated cardiac cath with right femoral access. During procedure DES was placed in the ostial LCx with residual 40-50% distal left main to LAD. Plan per interventional is ASA, plavix, IVF overnight with plan for TTE, consult in the AM. Of note patient received ample versed and Fentanyl  \n\nOn arrival to the floor, patient without complaint. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations. Tolerating PO without nausea, vomiting. Chronic back pain is at its baseline. Last BM yesterday.\n",
