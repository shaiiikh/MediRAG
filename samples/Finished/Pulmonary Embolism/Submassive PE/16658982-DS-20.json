This was thought to be related to her h/o varicose veins and so was advised to continue monitoring. At that time also had increased frequency of palpitations (with known history of paroxysmal a-tach) and so metoprolol was doubled and received Holter monitor. Later that week developed worsening dyspnea to the point that she was unable to walk across a parking lot without losing her breath. This was very unusual for her, as at baseline she is very active and had even completed a hiking trip. \n\ufeff\nHer PCP referred her where she was found to have be hypoxic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Labs revealed D-dimer elevation 7.2, troponin-I elevation to 0.815, NT proBNP elevated at 2374. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with anterior lateral TWI (V2-V6). CT chest showed moderate bilateral pulmonary emboli with the largest being in the right lower lobe, mild RV dilation, with main pulmonary artery dilated 3.6 cm.  Echocardiogram was obtained prior to transfer which was significant for positive sign, moderately dilated right ventricle, with moderately reduced RV function. LV function was normal.\n\ufeff\nShe was subsequently transferred where hospital course was notable for multiple episodes of SVT with rates into the 160s. Repeat troponin-T was reassuring at 0.02. ICU team was consulted for consideration thrombolytics which were felt to be unnecessary. Per family request, she was subsequently transferred for further evaluation.\n\ufeff\nUpon arrival to the ICU, she reports feeling overall well but continues to be mildly dyspneic. Did have mild episode of vague chest pain earlier last week but that has since resolved. No other new symptoms at this time. She thinks she is up to date onroutine cancer screening, including colonoscopy, Pap, and mammogram, though exact details are somewhat unclear and with further questioning is not entirely confident. No recent operations or significant immobilization. No family history of clotting disorders. No personal history of intracranial or other significant bleeding disorders.\n\ufeff\n10-point review of systems was negative except as detailed above.\n\ufeff\n",
