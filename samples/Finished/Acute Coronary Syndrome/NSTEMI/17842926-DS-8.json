Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 64 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\ufeff\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Increased PCWP. \n\ufeff\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed), the findings are similar.\n"
