She also experienced chest discomfort, located the chest, non radiating. She presented to her PCP and was told she was dehydrated, so she has been trying to drink lots of water since that time. This morning she again experienced severe dyspnea associated with chest discomfort  while walking to the bathroom and decided to present to ED. She denies fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND swelling.

No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is noted.  No pneumothorax seen.  The visualized bony structures are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study, a compression deformity at the cervical lumbar junction is similar in degree.\nIMPRESSION: \nModerate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.\n\ufeff\nTTE:\nConclusions   \nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\ufeff\nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional left ventricular systolic function. Dilated right ventricle with normal global systolic function. Moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), right ventricle is now mildly enlarged. The other findings are similar.  \n\ufeff\n- Cardiac pharmacologic perfusion\nFINDINGS:  Left ventricular cavity size is normal Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium. Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 73% \n  \nIMPRESSION:  No myocardial perfusion defect.  No wall motion abnormalities. Normal EF. \n\ufeff\n\n"
