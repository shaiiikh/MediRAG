Ms. White reported to be in her otherwise usual state of health up until about 12  this afternoon.  She was found down in the bathroom face down at around 1.  At that time, she was reportedly responding to questions but with possible left-sided weakness. She was taken urgently to an outside hospital, where she was initially found to have a blood pressure of 170s-200s, with left-sided weakness including a facial droop.  Her clinical exam apparently deteriorated to a GCS of 4, necessitating intubation. \n\ufeff\nShe underwent a noncontrast head CT which revealed a large 101 cc intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered around the right basal ganglia with 1 cm midline shift.  Her INR was found to be 3.4 on initial evaluation.  She received K Centra, vitamin K and FFP. She was initiated on nicardipine drip prior to transfer. At ED, she was evaluated by neurosurgery.  \n\ufeff\nHer healthcare proxy was designated to be one Ms. White, who is a named healthcare proxy and who is the geriatric facilities.\n",
