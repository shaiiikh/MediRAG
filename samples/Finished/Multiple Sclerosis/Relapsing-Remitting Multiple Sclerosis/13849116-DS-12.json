The symptoms first started 2 weeks ago when her left knee \"buckled back\", which she describes as locking in an extended position. She saw her PCP who thought this was likely OA given her history of OA and she was given a knee brace which helped some. About 1 week later she developed left hip, low back, and shoulder pain. The shoulder pain radiates to the right and down her spine. She describes the pain as achy, tingling and very itchy. She then noticed bl feet parasthsias L>R. She had one event tingling in her her face and bl arms when she was reading. She reports the parasthesias seem worse when she is in the heat. She denies lhermitte's.
