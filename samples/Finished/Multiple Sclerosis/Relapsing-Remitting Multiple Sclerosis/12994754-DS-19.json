It was not more prominent in a particular position of gaze. The diplopia resolved completely if she closed one eye. Over the course of the day the diplopia became more severe and she noted transient blurring of her vision. She denies any visual field loss. The blurred vision seemed concordant with the onset of a constant, dull, bilateral retro-orbital headache. The headache improves if she closes her eyes. It is not positional, no worse with cough or valsalva. She denies any neck pain. The diplopia persists, and the pt now presents to the neurology floor for direct admission for further evaluation and treatment. At present she is tearful at times and visibly distressed by her symptoms. She denies any paresthesia, weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia. She denies any difficulty initiating or fully emptying her bladder. Denies dysuria or increased frequency. No diarrhea or constipation. She reports having a small pustular rash that is improving over her right shoulder. No pain from her port-a-cath site. She has chronic  skin breakdown over the stump on her right BKA, but no discharge or purulence.\n \nShe had a six- day course of IV  methylprednisolone, started Avonex. Stopped Avonex for depression. Steroid course for burning sensation in LUE and LLE later developing trigeminal neuralgia. Steroids given again for double vision. On standing steroid infusion q3 months in addition. \n",
