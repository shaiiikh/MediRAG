Left atrial abnormality. Delayed A-V conduction. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the heart rate is faster. \n\nIMAGES:\nCHEST XRAY ___\nLung volumes are diminished. There is patchy opacity in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe. There is a small left pleural effusion which was present on the prior examination. Evidence of median sternotomy and valve replacement is again noted. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size. There is no pneumothorax. Multiple healed right-sided rib fractures again incidentally noted. \n\nCT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___\nThere is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, large areas of edema, or mass effect. There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci, most likely due to age-related parenchymal atrophy. Hypodense areas are seen within the cerebellar hemispheres, most likely due to small vessel ischemic changes. Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses show some mild mucosal thickening of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Mastoid air cells are clear. \n\nCT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ___\nPatchy consolidation is seen within the left lower lobe of the lung consistent with pneumonia. A small pleural effusion is also seen on the left. In addition, there is dependent atelectasis in the right lung. The heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion is noted. \n  \nThe liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and intra- abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits. There are tiny non- obstructing renal stones seen within the kidneys bilaterally. In addition, multiple well-circumscribed hypodense areas are seen within the kidneys bilaterally, most consistent with cysts, unchanged. There is diffuse calcification of the abdominal aorta and the splenic, celiac, common hepatic, and iliac arteries. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air or free fluid is seen. High-density material is seen within the dependent portion of the second segment of the duodenum, which may be due to recent ingestion of high density material (ie medication or contrast).\n\nSputum with MRSA bronch: sensitive to Clinda, Tetracycline, Bactrim, Vancomycin, (Resistant to Erythro, Oxacillin, Penicillin, Cefazolin).\n\n"
