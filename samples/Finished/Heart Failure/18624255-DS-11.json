Most recently admitted with dyspnea thought secondary to exacerbation from severe MR vs afib. She was transferred for Mitraclip evaluation, where she was admitted. She was not a candidate for MitraClip at this time due to extensive calcifications and valve area too large. Following that admission, she was established with home hospice.  She has had 2 recent episodes of flash plum edema that was controlled with increasing bumex and O2 and morphine. Pt struggling at home right now with frequent flash pulm edema episodes. Also has poor appetite likely from gut edema. Per PCP, while pt is home hospice. She and her daugther would like to be admitted for optimization and IV diuretics.\n\ufeff\nPatient has been in contact with Dr. making adjustments to meds.

Patient has been unable to lie on a bed for some time as she feel very SOB. In the past week, have noticed increasing DOE, has been unable to cook or walk around the house comfortably, now can only walk to the bathroom and back. Patient has noted increasing distention, increasing satiety with meals, nausea, and has not had a bowel movement in 3 days. Family has not noted any triggers for exacerbation, including fever, chills, medication noncompliance, dietary indiscretions or otherwise. patient noted chest heaviness when walking up stairs, and now has moved downstairs. \n\ufeff\nOn the floor patient received IV Lasix 80mg. \n\ufeff\nROS: On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

The heart continues to be enlarged, and there is mild pulmonary edema is with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.  The right hilus is enlarged, presumably due to acute cardiac decompensation.  A large mitral annulus calcifications can be seen with mitral regurgitation. \n  \nThe left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with global hypokinesis and regional inferior/infero-lateral,\n"
