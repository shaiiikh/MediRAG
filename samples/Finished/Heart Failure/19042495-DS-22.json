Patient reprots she had a similar episode when her PPM was placed. This was done so we do not have the records of this. Otherwise she has not had symptoms of heart failure. She reports that she went on a cruise with her family a fwe4 weeks ago. On the last day of the cruise she started to feel tired. AFter this she continued to have progressive DOE to the point that she was unable to get dressed without significant SOB yesterday. She thought it mgiht be from graduation parties and the traveling she was doing.  She was seen by her PCP in clinic today where she reported subjective air hunger at rest, signficant shortness of breath on minimal exertion, eg gettingdressed. VS in clinic were: Wt. 157 lbs (was 151 on visit just one month ago) P 77 BP 160/68 (standing 164/80) %O2 Sat 94. BP slightly elevated from her baseline, systolic 160. O2 sat 94%, lower than baseline. EKG suggestive of possible infarction so she was sent into the ED.  \n \n.  \nIn the ED, initial vitals were: 98.9 70 190/81 22 100% 4L Nasal Cannula. The patient c/o SOB with exertion x 2 weeks since returning from travel. Denies CP. Denies orthopnea or PND.. She was speaking in full sentences. Pt lives in a studio apt and states she gets winded just getting to the bathroom. An ECG showed paced rhythm consistent with prior. CXR showed pulmonary congestion. She was given lasix 20mg IV X 1 and admitted for CHF likely dietary indiscretion while on her cruise.  There were no VS recorded prior to transfer in the E-signout from the MD.  On arrival to the floor patient c/o non-productive cough worse in the past few weeks in addition to the symptoms of DOE worsening to the point that she could not shower, PND, and edema. She has also had stable orthopnea, and her usual palpitations associated with her atrial fibrillation and chest pressure that comes on when she goes into Afib. She denies other chest pain, syncope, presyncope. She does note a weight gain that she attributes to the food on the cruise. She has also had night sweats several nights a week for the last months that require a change of clothes. She is uptodate on her mammograms and has had a colonoscopy in the last years that per her report was normal.  \n\ufeff\n",

Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged with unfolding of the thoracic aorta.

Small right pleural effusion is present. No pneumothorax is identified. There are mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. Coils are partially imaged within the upper aspect of the abdomen.
