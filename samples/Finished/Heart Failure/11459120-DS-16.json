She reports having increased urinary frequency in the past month, and especially in the past week.  She had one episode of chills in her apartment but her temperature at that time was 99, per her report.  She has oxygen for nighttime use at home, but felt that she was still dyspneic at rest even when on 2L.\n\nShe called her NP yesterday and was diagnosed with a UTI and rx'd macrobid, of which she has taken two doses.  She called EMS this morning when she was lethargic and felt nauseous despite not having eaten anything.  On arrival to the ED, she was noted to be very pale.  Her initial vitals were 97.8 82 ___ 98%(2L).  Hemeoccult was negative.  Her crit was low at 29 and her INR was high at 4.1 while in the ED.  CXR showed increased fluid in the lungs, with some question of focal R opacities that could be infectious in nature.  She was given 40 mg IV lasix, had a catheter placed and was transferred to the floor for diuresis.  She reports having two pillow orthopnea at baseline and is not sure of her dry weight.  She does not weigh herself daily.\n",

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.\"\n"
