Then, for days prior to her presentation to OSH, she had severe N/V/anorexia that prevented her from keeping any POs down. On admission to OSH, noted to have BP of 81/50 and Cr of 6. Pt was volume resuscitated with IVF, with improvement in BP and Cr returned to baseline of less than 1. Pt continued to have severe nausea and vomiting, with guaiac + stools. Work up was done to r/o bowel obstruction. Upper GI did not show any obstruction but upper endoscopy on showed duodenal stenosis. NG tube suction was initiated and pt reported improvement in symptoms. The plan was to rescope pt with plan to perform balloon plasty on if necessary. Pt desired to be transferred to where her primary MD practices and wished to get a second opinion. Upon arrival at , pt was febrile and tachycardic with low-normal BP, however she denied any symptoms. Pt is feeling better than she ever has in a long time. No abdominal pain, n/v.
