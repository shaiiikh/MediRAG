There is an increased amount of layering hemorrhage in the left occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle. A small amount of intraventricular blood is noted in the right occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle, unchanged. There is surrounding edema, appears stable from prior CT. Also noted is a hypodense area in the left frontal lobe that appears unchanged and likely represents encephalomalacia from a prior infarct. There is no shift of midline structures. There is no new area of hemorrhage identified. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Stable left thalamic hemorrhage with slight increase in intraventricular hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle. \n2. No new areas of hemorrhage identified. \n\ufeff\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date\nIMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.\n\ufeff\nMR-HEAD:\nFINDINGS: Limited MRI study secondary to patient motion. Only sagittal T1, axial T1, and axial FLAIR sequences were obtained, which were also markedly degraded by patient motion. Within these limitations, left thalamic hematoma is redemonstrated, with surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality. There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift. Size of the hematoma appears similar to that \nseen on the previous CT. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal MRI study secondary to patient motion. Left thalamic hematoma is redemonstrated. A repeat MRI study may be obtained after adequately sedating the patient. \n\ufeff\nCT_HEAD\nPreliminary Report  \n1. Stable left basal ganglia hemorrhage with partial resorption of intraventricular blood in the lateral ventricles. \n2. No new areas of hemorrhage.\n"
