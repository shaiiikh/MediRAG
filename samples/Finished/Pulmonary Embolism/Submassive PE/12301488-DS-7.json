He states that he is usually able to do this hill multiple times in a day without any difficulty. However he noted that he was quite dyspneic, requiring him to rest. Had associated chest pressure located over midchest that self terminated after several minutes. Denied palpitations, cough, hemoptysis, fevers, chills, NS, changes in weight. When he went home, he again developed dyspnea while working on a project with associated chest pressure. He took 2 aspirin and his symptoms alleviated after an hour. He went to sleep asymptomatic however the next morning he again developed DOE and chest pressure which prompted him to go to ED for evaluation. \n\ufeff\nHe initially presented where he was found to have tropI of 0.32 with EKG with RBBB (unclear if new). He was plavix loaded and heparinized and transferred for cardiac catheterization. On day of cath he was found to have 50% LAD lesion but otherwise normal coronaries. He was then admitted for further work-up. While on the floor patient remained notably dyspneic.  CTA was completed showing evidence of right heart strain. \n\ufeff\n",

A smaller burden of segmental embolism in the left pulmonary arterial tree. \n3.  There is no specific CT evidence of right heart strain, although clinical correlation is recommended.  \n4. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\ufeff\nPortable TTE (Complete) Done at 3:12:17    \nFINAL Conclusions  \nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\ufeff\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular systolic hypertrophy with low normal global systolic function. Mild right ventricular dilatation and mild global systolic dysfunction. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.   \n\ufeff\n"
