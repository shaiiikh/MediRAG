Her mouth was 'full of saliva' and she states this was unusual. She didn't speak with anyone at that time. Over the course of the day other people described her speech as \"halting\" she felt as if she got \"stuck.\" She also kept using the wrong words for things, such as substituting \"wires\" for weather. She eventually presented to the ED that evening as She reported these same language difficulties in her native language. She had no other difficulties including no dysphagia, no dysarthria, no weakness/numbness, no difficulty walking, no difficulty driving. In fact, her son got lost driving her to the hospital, but a person was able to correct this and navigate them to the hospital. She was at her baseline over the preceding days and the only thing out of the ordinary was having 2 glasses of wine the night before and going to bed later than usual, around 0100.\n",
