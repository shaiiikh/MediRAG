    "input2": "She is a woman with active breast cancer who recently started adriamycin and taxol. She tolerated the first two treatements of taxol but then developed shortness of breath. Suspecting anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, she got an echo that was unremarkable. A CTA was performed to evaluate for PE and was also negative. The onc attending wants to admit for a cardiac work-up including possible stress test and PFTs. She is clinically stable, 99% on RA, HR increases to 140s with exercise. She does not appear volume overloaded and lasix for the past few weeks has not changed her symptoms.\nINTERVAL HISTORY: She with stage IIA invasive ductal L. breactcancer s/p bilateral mastectomy who presents for week 4of weekly Taxol s/p dd-AC on trial. Her scheduledweek 4 treatment was held due to persistent edema andexertional shortness of breath.Since her last visit she has had little improvement in her SOB.Her PE-CT was normal and her edema has improved off Taxol.She continues to have exertional SOB associated with mildsubsternal discomfort which resolves with rest in less than. No rest pain, N/V, dizziness. She denies fevers,chlls, cough. She is able to walk slowly for several meterswithout symptoms. No PND. No palpitations.She continues to have some rectal pain with bowel movements whichshe describes as throbbing/burning/itching. There is no painbetween bowel movements. She rarely notices a small amount ofblood on several of her stools. She is using baby wipes and buttpaste to minimize the irritation. No fevers or chills. Herappetite is below baseline although her weight is stable. She denies N/V. Her hot flashes, and sweating have nearly resolved. Shecontinues to sporadic headaches, and denies associated visionchanges, neck stiffness, focal weakness. Her sleep hassignificanly improved on Trazadone and she is currently using150mg PO QHS.ROS:A complete review of systems is otherwise negative. \n\ufeff\n",

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
