Got worse over next few days, with discomfort both with breathing and without taking deep breaths.  She is a marathon runner, and ran most recently in the middle of last week.  She had no shortness of breath.  The pain was worse with lying down and with inspiration.  Pain is not relieved with motrin.\n.\nShe saw a PCP coverage last week, and had a CXR that showed a small pleural effusion on the right.  The pain persisted and worsened, and she presented for further care for a follow up visit to her PCP.  A repeat CXR was done which showed worsening effusion, and question of right lung infiltrate.  A CT scan was done due to her pleuritic chest pain and she was found to have a right middle and lower lobe PE.  She was sent to the ED for evaluation.\n.\nShe has noticed decreased exercise tolerance in the past few weeks while running, and a few myalgias.  She had no lower extremity edema, pain or swelling.  No recent travel.  No dizziness, headache, abdominal complaints.  \n.\nROS otherwise reviewed in detail and negative.\n.\nIn the ED, she was started on a heparin drip, and admitted for further care.\n",
