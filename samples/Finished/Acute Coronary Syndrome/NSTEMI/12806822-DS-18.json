Once the pain occured he sat down, and the pain lasted a total of 10 minutes and completely went away. Pt did admit that he had some R hand numbness. Pt did not take an asprin or any other med, and when he got back home did take one prilosec. The pain was different from indigestion he has been having over the last couple months which is lower on his chest and a feeling offullness and some acid reflux feeling. Pt said he also had similar CP on (4d ago) when doing yard work and shoveling, and also later that night with the same pattern of pain/length and resolution when resting.\n \nOn review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
