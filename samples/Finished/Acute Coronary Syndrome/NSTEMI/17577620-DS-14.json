Over the course of the next two hours the pain became more of a bilateral anterior chest pressure. The pain was not positional, not exertional, had mild associated SOB but no n/v/diaphoresis. After that time, the chest pain began improving spontaneously and by the time he went to his scheduled PCP appointment this morning, he had some remnant left sided chest pressure but his other symptoms had resolved. \n\ufeff\nAt his PCP's office, he reported these symptoms and was given SL nitro x1, aspirin 324mg, and an EKG was performed which showed atrial fibrillation, regular and paced beats. No change from EKG.\n\ufeff\nPer EMS report, en route patient began having frequent PVCs. Per initial report there was concern about wide-complex tachycardia for which patient received 150mg amiodarone. His BP was stable,no chest pain, mentating well. On review of the rhythm strips this rhythm was likely more consistent with V-pacing, heart rate of about 100 bpm rather than a wide-complex tachycardia or VT.\n\ufeff\nIn the ED, patient reported feeling well without any ongoing chest pain. \n- Initial vitals were: T 96.9 HR 97 BP 124/91 RR 18 O2 sat 97% RA\n- EKG afib/aflutter, V pacing. Normal rate. \n- Labs/studies notable for: trop 0.13, Mg 1.3, WBC 14.3. Cr at baseline 0.9. LFTs wnl. \n- Patient was given: 2g Mg\n\ufeff\nOn ROS, patient denies shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, diaphoresis, recent exertional chest pain, lower extremity edema, cough, fevers. He does state that for the past 4 or 5 days he has had several episodes of diarrhea daily, though he has a history of intermittent diarrhea for which he sees GI and this is not significantly different.
