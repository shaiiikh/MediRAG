Pt is poor historian. She did report liquidy, brown, non-bloody diarrhea for 6 days prior to presentation with resulting limited PO intake. The diarrhea was associated with crampy, diffuse/epigastric abdominal pain. She denied nausea but reported vomiting a few times (non-bloody). She denied fevers, chills, urinary symptoms. No chest pain or SOB, per patient, though NH records did indicate SOB and DOE.  \n\nPatient had recent admission s/p fall with CHF exacerbation. At that time, her meds were changed.  \n\nUpon admission, the patient was on: Asa 81mg daily, torsemide 20mg BID, HCTZ 12.5 daily, Amiodarone 200mg daily, Lisinopril 2.5mg daily, Warfarin, Metoprolol 12.5mg daily, and KCL 20mg daily.  \n.  \nUpon discharge, the patient was on: ASA 81, Amiodarone 200 daily, Warfarin, KCl 40 daily, Metoprolol 12.5 BID, Lasix 60qam and 40qpm, lisinopril 2.5 daily, and tylenol prn.  \n\nASA was stopped. K and Ca were d/c'd and lasix was changed to qod patient c/o nausea. The physician noted pitting edema and changed her Lasix to 80mg daily. Her dry weight is 128-130lbs. Her weight upon admission was 135 and her weight upon transfer was 137.3. She never \nhad an oxygen requirement.  \n\nIn the ED, the patient had a CXR showing question of a retrocardiac opacity as well as pleural effusions. She was given Levofloxacin for possible PNA. BNP was elevated at 5802 (was 733 at OSH. EKG was unchanged fBNP was elevated at 5802rom prior with stable trop (0.10). A CT abd w/o contrast was performed for her diarrhea and revealed no pathology. LFT's were normal. Vitals 96.9 BP 104/45 HR 51 RR 17 96% RA. 900cc urine output in ED. Admitted for likely CHF exacerbation.  \n \nOn the floor, pt had no complaints. She denied CP, SOB and reported improvement in abdominal cramping. She had one large liquid brown stool on arrival to the floor.\n",

Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition may be due in part to left anterior fascicular block and/or prior anterior myocardial infarction. Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave changes. Prominent U waves could be due in part to bradycardia or possible  drug/metabolic/electrolyte effect. Since previous tracing, no significant change \n\nCXR:\n___: FINDINGS: The previously noted Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. No lines are in place at this time. There are diminished lung volumes. Extensive retrocardiac opacity is noted, likely atelectasis, although an early developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle and to a lesser severity on the right as well, possibly due to small effusions. No gross consolidation is seen. There is no definite superimposed edema. Again noted is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged but stable. No displaced fractures are evident. IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There are likely bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left. \n\nAbdominal XR: \n___: FINDINGS: Study is mildly compromised secondary to habitus. No definite dilated loops of small bowel are evident. There is stool throughout the descending colon. No abnormal calcifications are noted overlying the renal fossae. There is a curvilinear calcification in the left deep pelvis, presumably vascular in origin. Extensive degenerative disease is noted throughout the included thoracolumbar spine. IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for obstruction. \n\nCT abd and pelvis:\n___: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Please note the lack of intravenous contrast, significantly limits detailed evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and bowel. There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right with associated atelectasis. Marked cardiomegaly is additionally noted. An 8-mm low-attenuation focus within the left lobe of the liver is too small to characterize but likely represents a simple cyst (2:21). Similarly, a 7-mm low-attenuation focus in the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize but also likely represents a simple cyst (2:26). The liver is otherwise unremarkable. Please note, moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites also limits detailed evaluation. The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and abdominal portions of the small bowel appear grossly unremarkable. There are bilateral simple renal cysts, the largest of which is located at the upper pole of the right kidney and measures 5.3 cm in diameter (2:20). The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. Numerous colonic diverticula are present. T\n"
