She reports that her BP was more elevated than usual this morning and kept increasing despite her taking multiple doses of Losartan, reaching the 200s in the evening. She felt somewhat lightheaded and developed pain in the left side of her chest and neck. She denied any headache, vision changes, hearing changes, muscle weakness, facial droop, difficulty speaking, or new paresthesias. She was concerned that her elevated BP might cause a stroke and impact her ability to live by herself. She has recently been treated with Macrobid for a UTI, and still has some suprapubic discomfort. She has been drinking lots of water to help flush out her bladder. Given her symptoms, her home health aide encouraged her to come in to the ED for evaluation.  \n\nInitial vitals in ED triage were T 99.2, HR 78, BP 172/80, RR 16, and SpO2 97% on 3L. Her BP was highly variable in the ED, ranging from SBP 150s-200s. CBC showed normocytic anemia with Hct 34.1 (similar to baseline), normal WBC and platelet counts, and unremarkable diff. Chemistry panel showed hyponatremia with Na 130 similar to several prior presentations and creatinine 0.9 (at baseline). Dilantin level was 11.4 within normal limits. Initial Troponin was negative. EKG reportedly showed sinus rhythm at 69 bpm with LAD and LBBB, unchanged from prior. CXR showed no acute process with official read pending. Her UA showed WBC 41 and few bacteria, improved fwhen she had urinalysis with WBC >182.  \n\nShe complained of nausea in the ED and was given Ondansetron 4 mg IV with good effect. She was given Diphenhydramine 25 mg PO once for unclear reasons. She was given Macrobid PO for ongoing UTI treatment. She was admitted to Cardiology for further management of hypertension and chest pain. Vitals prior to floor transfer were T 98 po, HR 62, BP 174/70, RR 16, and SpO2 100% on RA. On reaching the floor, she reported feeling much better and denied any chest pain, neck pain, SOB, headache, or new neurological symptoms.\n",
