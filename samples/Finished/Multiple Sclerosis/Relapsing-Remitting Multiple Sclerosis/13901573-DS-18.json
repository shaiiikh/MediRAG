    "input2": "She is a woman who presents with one day of right foot parasthesias as well as waxing and waning symptoms in her left foot and hands. \n\ufeff\nShe was in her normal state of health two days ago when she went to sleep. Yesterday morning she woke from sleep with tingling in both feet which felt \"like frostbite,\" which were worst in the right foot. She attributed this to stress and went about her  day. She noticed some difficulty swallowing when eating peas and rice. The symptoms remained constant in her feet and spread to her hands as well. They were present in her hands and feet when she went to bed. At 3 AM she woke from sleep with more severe pain in her feet, right more than left, and a feeling of shortness of breath, tongue heaviness and difficulty breathing, as well as sweating and tremulousness of the hands. For this reason she presented to the emergency department. She has had waxing and waning tingling in her hands bilaterally.  Prior to my seeing her she received toradol with improvement in her hands and left foot but not in her feet. Her breathing has improved.\n\ufeff\nHer menses started yesterday and she has a history of catameial migraine but she denies any headache. In addition, the symptoms she awoke with this morning are similar to her past panic attacks, which reportedly feel \"like death.\" She does endorse several stressful events recently, including multiple funerals, recent diagnosis of bartholin gland cyst with drainage, and urinary tract infection for which she has completed treatment. These problems have not relapsed. She has not been sleeping well for several weeks. She is also thinking about changing Neurologists. She is upset that Dr her to return to clinic before renewing her lorazepam and she feels that he just wants to give her more medications, not make her better.\n\ufeff\nIn the ED she said his symptoms had subsided and her condition had returned to a stable state. She said similar situations had happened before.\n",
