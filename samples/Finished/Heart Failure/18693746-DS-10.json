There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  On color Doppler imaging, there is an interatrial shunt consistent with stretched PFO or an atrial septal defect. (Images of the interatrial septum were suboptimal in the prior study). Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), the mid anterolateral wall now appears more hypokinetic and the anterior apex is now hypokinetic (may have been foreshortened in the prior study). The aortic valve gradient is similar. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %)\n"
