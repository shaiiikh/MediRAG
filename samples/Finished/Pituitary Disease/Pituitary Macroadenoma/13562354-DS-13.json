Her symptoms started earleir this year when she went on a cruise. She noted blurry vision in both eyes during that cruise.  Subsequently, she developed diffuse headaches, nausea, and photophobia.  HA's are daily, and she received a short course of Prednisone several weeks ago to treat these, which was successful, but they returned after Prendisone was discontinued. At the same time her visual acuity was deteriorating and she was prescribed glasses, which did not ameliorate her vision.  She underwent an MRI elsewhere which showed the above mentioned sellar lesion.\n",

Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The gray-white differentiation is preserved. The basilar cisterns are patent.Evaluation of bony structures reveals minimal postoperative changes within the right sphenoid air cells, and aerosolized fluid throughout the sphenoid and ethmoid air cells. The visualized portions of the maxillary sinuses are largely clear, with a small fluid level in the right maxillary sinus dependently. The mastoid air cells are clear. There is no fracture. Soft tissues are unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No intracranial hemorrhage following trans-sphenoidal resection. Postoperative changes in the sella and sphenoid air cells.\n2.
