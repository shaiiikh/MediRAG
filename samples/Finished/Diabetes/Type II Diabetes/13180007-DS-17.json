They describe fluctuating cognitive and functional abilities since his CVA, which seem to have accelerated after hospitalization. Since that time, they have noted that he has had progressive short termmemory loss, often asking the same question repeatedly, thencalling the other daughter and asking the same question. Mostsignificantly, although he states that he takes his medicationsconsistently, in fact his daughters are both aware that he veryrarely takes them,including his insulin and antihypertensivesThey describe him as \"at his best\" when they are around, able toprovide food and ensure that he is taking his medications,although they also both believe that he is prescribed \"too manymedications,\" and that when he takes all of them, he is morefatigued and less interactive. His daughters are clear that,despite this impression, they never discourage him from takinghis prescribed medications, which he receives in bubble packs since his last discharge. \n\ufeff\nHe apparently told his daughters that hewas reaching for green bananas, lost his balance, and fell,rolling down the hill. He was able to get up \"little by little.\"When he came home, he apparently thought that he wasstill, confused his wife for his daughter. On morning, he fell again. He was confused about theconfiguration of the bathroom (no tub in bathroom in PR), so hetripped and fell, called his daughter in tears (he often getsemotional since his CVA). She booked an appointment for same day,at which his FSBG>500, HbA1c (point of care, not in OMR) was15.0%. He declined to be transferred to the ED. Daughter was on vacation from work, and so was able to check on himregularly. During these visits, she again established that he isnot taking prescribed medications. On the morning of presentation, pt's wife called daughter, concerned that ptwas increasingly confused. FSBG was >500, and administeredTresiba 50u at about 8 am. Pt called about 15 minuteslater, at which time she again noted confusion and slurredspeech, which has intermittently been present since his CVA.Decision was made to bring him to the ED. \n\ufeff\nOf note, during his last hospitalization , he had anepisode of dysarthria with confusion and mild expressive andreceptive aphasia for which code stroke was called. MRI/MRA brainand EEG were unrevealing, with chronic changes and EEG slowing only. He was continued on ASA and atorvastatin. \n\ufeff\n",
