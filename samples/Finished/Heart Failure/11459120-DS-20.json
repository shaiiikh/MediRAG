Does not note any significant increasing edema. Denies CP, f/c. States he's noticed a mild cough with white phlegm production recently. Also thinks glands might be swollen. Saw Cardiologist, had CXR done, which showed known (?loculated) L pleural effusion which is now larger. Pt referred to interventional pulm for drainage of L pleural effusion, however unable to get appt until late. Contacted cardiologist for continued SOB/DOE/orthopnea, subsequently advised to come to ED for admission/tx of CHF and possible drainage of L pleural effusion. Denies fevers, chills, sweats.  States smoked 4ppd, but quit. Denies any previous admissions for SOB or CHF. Was last admitted for CABG, echo at the time showed EF 50-55%, PCWP 18. States he used water pills years ago, but nothing previously. ED vitals were 97.2 74 160/66 20 98% RA. Labs sig for BNP 7299 (no previous), Trop 0.02, Cr 1.1, lytes unremarkable, WBC 8.9 (N 72%), Hct 33.2. Given furosemide 40mg IV and ASA 325mg. UOP in ED was 600cc. ECG SNR, rate 75, poor R wave progression, otherwise unremarkable. CXR showed small bilateral effusions, increase in pulmonary interstitial edema from prior exam. VS prior to transfer, 98.1 76 151/82 16 100%RA. Given 20mg IV furosemide at 6 AM. Patient diuresed 1200cc overnight \n\nOn the floor, pt was comfortable with orthopnea, but no complaints sitting up. States he's been urinating a lot. Notes some bilateral shoulder discomfort when lying flat, worse on left side. Resolves when sitting up. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope\n",
