Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to apical hypokinesis with focal apical dyskinesis. The inferior and posterior walls (suboptimally visualized) may also be hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.\n"
