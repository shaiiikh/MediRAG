On evening, the patient became dizzy and the room was spinning when he arose from sitting.  he described a right frontal headache located primarily behind his eye.  He didn't think much of it and went to bed.  On the following morning, the patient ate breakfast and felt fairly normal.  Shortly thereafter, he again felt dizzy (room spinning),became nauseated and vomited.  He laid down on the floor to try and relax.  Because the patient didn't feel better, he called his son to take him to hospital. Since that time, he complains of an intermittent headache located in the posterior (occipital) area.\n\ufeff\nthe patient initially underwent a non-contrast CT and CTA.  CT was a normal study and CTA was most notable for distal left ICA stenosis and moderate to severe focal stenosis of left vertebral artery.  \n\ufeff\nToday, the patient was being transported to radiology for a MRI study.  While in transit, the patient became clammy and dizzy and didn't feel well enough to sit through the exam.  Instead, he underwent a repeat non-contrast CT which revealed a right cerebellar infarct with effacement of the fourth ventricle.  As a result, arrangements were made to send the patient to a hospital department for neurosurgical evaluation.\n",
