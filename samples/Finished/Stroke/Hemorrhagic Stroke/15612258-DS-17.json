Compared to head CT from 6 hours prior, there is interval increase in the size of a large right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema. There is midline extension of the bleed, resulting in 13 mm of midline shift, previously 6 mm. Again seen is significant mass effect with near complete effacement of the right lateral ventricle. There is now extension of the bleed into the ventricles with layering blood noted in the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle.

The remaining basal cisterns remain patent. \n  \nThere is near complete opacification of the right mastoid sinus, and mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells. The remaining paranasal sinuses,mastoid air cells,and middle ear cavities are clear.
