The patient has widely metastatic cancer, and is status-post a nephrectomy, lung wedge resection and is currently on PD1/TK1 trial therapy. He has probable metasteses to the pancreas, lung and adrenal glands. He was asymptomatic, and was undergoing a routine staging CT, which was not timed as a CTA but was concerning for a large filling defect in the right main pulmonary artery.\n\ufeff\nThe patient was sent to the ED from radiology, and despite there not being an exact agreement on whether this represents an actual PE given the study was not timed for pulmonary artery imaging, he is clearly high-risk for thrombosis given his metastatic cancer. Bilateral LENIs were performed in the ED which were negative. While he had some classic EKG changes for right heart strain, this was not changed from prior EKGs. He was not hypoxemic in the ED, with a SAO2 of 98% on room air. The plan was to start empiric enoxoparin, and while a repeat CTA would be desirable, this was not done given the risk to his lone kidney on top of the recent dye load.\n\ufeff\n",
