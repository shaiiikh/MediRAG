She pushed life alert and EMS came. They helped her back into bed. She later attempted to walk to the bathroom and fell again. However she did hit the back of her head and neck on a window as she fell. Denies LOC before or after fall. Denies chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness. States she often falls because her knees give out. \n\nShe does feel weak overall.  She has stable 2 pillow orthopnea and DOE (can not walk more than a block). She does not take her lasix for her CHF because it makes her urinate too frequently. States she is on 1.5L of O2 at home for \"her heart.\" She has been eating less than usual lately because she does not have an appetite. She denies fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. She denies dysuria or hematuria but does endorse urinary frequency. She denies any fever or chills but does have chronic productive cough. She was treated for a UTI last week with p.o. Cipro and finished antibiotic for several days ago. She has a history of recurrent UTIs (see below). \n\nHx of recurrent UTIs: Last UTI with multi-drug resistant organism. Pt was tx with Macrodantin. Recently saw Dr. B urology. It is unclear whether these represent symptomatic UTIs or is just asymptomatic bacteriuria.  Pt states that everytime she falls she finds out she has a UTI. She denies any dysuria, hematuria, subprapubic pain, smelling or cloudy urine during these episodes. Does state she has urinary freq and incontinence.\n \nPt video-urodynamic study in that showed Hypersensitive, low capacity bladder, Reflux grade to both kidneys, Detrusor over activity- terminal. Pt given Gentamycin 80 mg IV  given right hip and started Cipro BID x five days. Plan for cystoscopy with Dr. B.\n\nHx of frequent falls: Pt states she has been falling frequently for several years. Had been having about one fall/mo but states now that she uses a walker she has been falling much less. Evaluated by neuro for these frequent falls (1x/mo) and gait problems (felt shakey and unsteady on her feet). Gait disorder and falls thought to be from by loss of proprioception due to large fiber peripheral neuropathy. Had been concern for NPH given enlarged ventricles out of proportion to atrophy on CT but given lack of clinical symptoms at that time, further workup not pursued.\n\nIn the ED, initial vs were: 99.0 98 180/96 20 96% 2L  Labs were remarkable for UA with neg nitrites, few bac, 29 wbc. INR 2.3. Patient was given Acetaminophen 500mg.   \n \nOn the floor, pt states she continues to have a mild right temporal headache and shoulder pain where she fell.  \n \nReview of sytems:  \n(+) Per HPI, +HA, + cough, +DOE, +chronic knee pain  \n(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria.  Ten point review of systems is otherwise negative.71 year old female with PMH of HTN, b/l PE, Afib s/p pacemaker, asthma now presenting with SOB and general malaise.  Pt reports having been feeling progressively more lethargic over the past two months; states that her last time at her USOH was 2 months ago.  She reports having increased urinary frequency in the past month, and especially in the past week.  She had one episode of chills in her apartment but her temperature at that time was 99, per her report.  She has oxygen for nighttime use at home, but felt that she was still dyspneic at rest even when on 2L.\n\nShe called her NP yesterday and was diagnosed with a UTI and rx'd macrobid, of which she has taken two doses.  She called EMS this morning when she was lethargic and felt nauseous despite not having eaten anything.  On arrival to the ED, she was noted to be very pale.  Her initial vitals were 97.8 82 ___ 98%(2L).  Hemeoccult was negative.  Her crit was low at 29 and her INR was high at 4.1 while in the ED.  CXR showed increased fluid in the lungs, with some question of focal R opacities that could be infectious in nature.  She was given 40 mg IV lasix, had a catheter placed and was transferred to the floor for diuresis.  She reports having two pillow orthopnea at baseline and is not sure of her dry weight.  She does not weigh herself daily.\n",

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.\"\n"
