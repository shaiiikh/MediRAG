Currently CP free, BPs 110s/74 HR 58, on RA. EKG notable initial submilimeter elevation AVL, no other elevations; resolved on repeat EKGs; noted TWI in AVF and VIII. Her troponins were elevated at 0.14, 0.21, and she was sent for PCI for NSTEMI. She was found to have a 99% occlusion of the RCA s/p DES and minimial residual disease in other vessels. Given full dose ASA and loaded with Plavix.\n\nCurrently she is chest pain free. She states that she has had small episodes of chest pressure and DOE recently that have always resolved quickly when she sits down. She denies headache, chest pain, fevers, chills, SOB, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nPositive per HPI.  \nCardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.  On further review of systems, denies fevers or chills. Denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
