Briefly, she has not had a flare which consisted of left foot numbness which completely resolved after a 5 day course of IV solumedrol. She was on plegridy up until a few weeks ago when she discovered she was pregnant, and stopped this medication. Upon evaluation by Dr. was felt that she could be experiencing another flare despite her pregnancy, and an admission was recommended, however patient decided to leave AMA. \n\ufeff\nShe states that a few hours after finishing her first infusion, she started to develop a sensation of her left side feeling \"off\" which she has difficulty describing, but endorses is difficulty functioning with her left hand, for example she is missing keys while texting on her phone. She is also experiencing tingling in the hand. She also endorses that her coordination and balance are \"off\", and that she has to hold on to walls while ambulating. This is new for her. She also had a sensation that her left eye \"wants to be closed\", but she denies any vision loss, blurred vision, or double vision.\n\ufeff\nInitially she attributed these symptoms to a side effect of solumedrol, however this morning she continued to experience them, and concerned, she called the on-call neurology resident who advised her to come to the ED for evaluation. She is not certain that the symptoms are getting worse, but they are certainly not improving.\n\ufeff\n",
