Early this morning he awoke with acute breathlessness prompting him to seek emergency care. His oxygenation was normal in the field. He was likewise normotensive without a supplemental oxygen requirement on arrival. His blood pressure later climbed to 191/113 but spontaneously lessened to162/94 in the next hour or so. His work of breathing, however, became more labored and oxygenation dropped to the low 90-range, prompting application of BiPAP. He was more comfortable thereafter. In fact, he was converted to nasal cannula just prior to transfer. His respiratory distress paralleled a rise inlactate from 5.7 -> 6.9. He had received one liter of fluid by this time. He has questionable opacification of the right lower lobe. He received ceftriaxone and azithromycin, in that regard.There are more interstitial infiltrates on his second chest x-ray as well. He is paced via single ventricular lead at 60. His underlying rhythm appears to fibrillation or flutter. NT-pro-BNPis 9500. Troponin is undetectable. CBC is notable for WBC of 11.1without immature forms. Hemoglobin is 9.7 and platelets are 84. There are nucleated red blood cells. BUN is 29. Creatinine is1.4.

There is no evidence for a right-to-left shunt with agitated saline at rest. The inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm). There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is SEVERE global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Left ventricular cardiac index is depressed(less than 2.0 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely lower due to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is moderate to severe [3+]tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be underestimated. There is SEVERE pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated.
