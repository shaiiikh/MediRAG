According to her son she was not short of breath prior to this event and has been walking distances of several miles, including stairs. No orthopnea or edema in her lower extremities. She did not have any chest pain prior to or during this event and denies any angina in the past six months. She denies recent illness. \n\ufeff\nthe patient was short of breath but without chest pain. Initial CXR indicated pulmonary edema and a BNP was elevated to 341. EKG was significant for old inferior wall infarct. Initial troponin was elevated to .53, which trended down to .38. She was given 40 of IV Lasix at which time her symptoms improved significantly. She was transferred for possible cardiac cath. Upon transfer she was no longer short of breath and had no signs of fluid overload on exam. \n\ufeff\nthe patient is not short of breath and denies chest pain. Initial vitals were 84 135/93 19 96% on Room O2.\n\ufeff\nOf note the patient had an inferior wall STEMI where she was found during cardiac cathaterization to have 3 vessel disease including a 70% lesion of the proximal RCA, which received a hepacoat stent. Successful PTCA of the small rPDA was performed. she was again hospitalized following a PEA arrest which was thought to be secondary to respiratory arrest in the setting of severe CAP. She was successfully \nresuscitated using a cooling protocol, treated with antibiotics and subsequently extubated with recovery of function. At that time she was found to have a chronic type B dissection distal to the L subclavian. Echo following this incident showed an EF, hypo to akinesis of the distal anterior septum, apex and basal/mid inferior and inferolateral segments and moderate mitral regurgitation. She has been healthy since being discharged to rehab after this admission.\n",
