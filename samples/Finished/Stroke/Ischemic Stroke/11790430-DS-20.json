Pt was in his usual state of health today.  At around 5pm, he developed slurred speech while sitting on the porch.  Denies any word finding difficulty, comprehension was intact.  He also wanted to stand up, but could not do it on his own, so he asked his wife to help him.  Pt denies any new onset focal weakness at that time. his wife was unable to help him stand up on her own, so she called a neighbor to help.  She also noticed that the left side of his face was droopy.  When the neighbor came over, they said that He should be immediately take to a hospital for an MRI.  So, wife and neighbor drove patient at the hospital.  Before leaving, she gave him Aspirin 325mg because she had heard in the past. There, a non contrast head CT was obtained which showed diffuse atrophy, white matter disease, but no hemorrhage or acute infarct.  He was transferred to hospital for further evaluation.  \n\ufeff\nPer wife, at baseline, He has gait instability and walks with a walker.  Wife is his primary caretaker.  She states that his left leg is always a little bit weaker than the right and he moves it less for her when she puts on his socks.  Pt is not seen by a neurologist  because he does not want to take the \"dopa medicine\" per his wife.  Apparently, pt's mother in law had terrible side effects from sinemet, so wife does not want He to have to experience that.\n\ufeff\nOn neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties comprehending speech. Denies focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.\n \nOn general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of breath.
